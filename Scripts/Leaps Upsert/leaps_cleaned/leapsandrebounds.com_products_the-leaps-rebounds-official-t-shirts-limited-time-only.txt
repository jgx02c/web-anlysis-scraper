    You've just bought your new trampoline from Leaps & Rebounds and you're enjoying getting healthy and in shape! Now that you've joined the family it's time to 'represent' with our newly designed Tank! This is the official Tank that we got made for everyone that works here at Leaps & Rebounds. This is available for a limited time only! -100% Soft cotton. True to size Ships anywhere in the US in 2-6 business days. Lifetime warranty for the rebounders and stabilizer bar. Quick and simple financing. Yes! The moisture-wicking fabric in both the men’s and women’s tanks helps keep you dry and comfortable, making it ideal for high-intensity workouts, yoga, running, and of course, trampoline exercises! The women’s tank top features a racerback with room to print, making it a great option for customization. However, we recommend consulting a professional for custom prints to ensure the best quality. The men’s tank top is made from 90/10 polyester/spandex moisture-management fabric, which provides moisture management and a relaxed fit. It doesn’t have the same spandex stretch as the women’s tank but offers excellent flexibility for movement. If you're between sizes, we recommend sizing up for a more relaxed fit and sizing down for a tighter, performance-style fit. This tank top is designed to be versatile! While it’s great for workouts, the soft, lightweight fabric makes it a comfortable everyday option for casual wear, whether you’re running errands or lounging at home. Get your bounce on! Try Leaps & Rebounds for 30 days and see how you feel! If you don't absolutely love it, for any reason we'll refund your money!
