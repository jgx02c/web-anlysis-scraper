Nadja's experiences offer valuable insights into cancer aftercare and how the bellicon supports improving quality of life. Nadja is a recognied expert in breast health and cancer communication from Germany. She uses her own experiences as a breast cancer patient to help others and break the taboo around cancer. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017, she has since become actively involved in raising awareness and supporting cancer patients. As an anaesthesia nurse and specialist in cancer communication, she shares her expertise through workshops, lectures, and webinars. Her work spans from cancer prevention and early detection to managing the side effects of cancer treatments. Nadja is dedicated to creating a safe space for women with cancer, where they can openly discuss topics like illness, death, and intimacy. You can find tips and tricks (in german) on her Instagram Account The Importance of Cancer Aftercare. Cancer aftercare is an essential part of a patient's treatment following primary therapy. Its goal is to monitor the success of treatment, detect relapses (recurrences) early, and improve the patient's quality of life. In addition to medical monitoring, cancer aftercare also considers psychological, social, and physical aspects of recovery, including measures to alleviate long-term effects and side effects of cancer treatments. Regular check-ups and targeted support, such as exercise therapy and counselling, play a central role. Nadja says:“The chances are incredibly good if we responsibly live with preventive and aftercare, that we can treat an emerging or existing cancer diagnosis curatively—or chronically, for life.” Cancer aftercare & bellicon Experience the unique benefits of gentle, joint-friendly exercises with the bellicon.

Her personal tip: “Stay connected to yourself and keep moving.” It is crucial that exercise is enjoyable, as this is the only way to maintain motivation. Advances in cancer research and treatment have shown that cancer is not synonymous with death. A diagnosis does not mean that nothing more can be done - on the contrary: life with cancer can and should be actively shaped. Modern medicine now offers curative treatment options, and although one in two people could develop cancer during their lives, the chances of a cure or chronic management of the disease are very good if prevention and aftercare are practiced consistently.
