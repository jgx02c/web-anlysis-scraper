    Home»Bungee or Spring Rebounder – What is the difference? We often get asked by customers about whether to choose a metal sprung rebounder or a bungee sprung rebounder. The simple answer is that both models have a place in the world of Rebounding and often it’s down to personal preference and budget. Before going into the different experiences you will have on these style rebounders, its important to note that with both designs to get the best experience, the best results, and the best longevity of use then choose a high quality premium rebounder that is designed and built to the top quality specification needed to bounce safely and effectively using high quality individual components. Also buy from a Company who can support you locally with expertise, warranty services and post-warranty spare parts. There are many cheap rebounders (we usually refer to these as mini-trampolines or trampettes) on the market that are really little more than a “toy” and you often find that the individual components cannot be replaced so if the mat wears out then the unit has to be disposed of. The key indicators to watch out for are: Don’t be put off Rebounding by trying this awesome exercise on sub-standard equipment! Here are a few considerations when selecting your rebounder. If you are still undecided then please do contact us to speak with our experts who will be very happy to assist you. The below is specific to our Rebound Fitness products but most you can apply to models from other manufacturers alongside the general considerations outlined above. If the answer is pure fitness and sports training then it’s probable that a metal sprung unit will suit your needs as long as it is well built, well sprung and has quality component parts. Our Rebound Fitness range of spring designed rebounders are perfect for this use. A metal sprung unit will give you a quicker return meaning you will be able to bounce faster as the upward propulsion is quicker (due to the rebounder being sprung at a medium to firmer tension ) and if you are bouncing at a faster tempo say 130pm + which is normal for mainstream fitness rebound classes/workouts then the metal sprung unit is ideal. If you want to use it for holistic bouncing/training or for slower and even straight leg bouncing (a bit like on a trampoline but obviously not so high) then it is likely that a good quality Bungee sprung rebounder is a better option for you. The bungee sprung unit gives a slower upward return so its very hard trying to complete workouts at a faster tempo as the bounce is slower and softer. You can still use the bungee sprung rebounder for fitness training. It is perfect for the beginner (who will bounce to a slower than 130bpm beat) or the advanced exerciser who will work harder as it takes more effort to propel upwards! If it is for adult use only then the metal sprung and the bungee sprung models are suitable. Each model comes with different accessories so take these into consideration when choosing the model that is best for you. If you want the rebounder for use by children, then please see our basic bounce video at the end of the blog. The most important thing is that the child can bounce with the correct technique, and not “jump” with straight legs like you would on a trampoline. If you feel that they are more likely to jump then we recommend the bungee model (otherwise it places strain on the mat springs which may break). The bungee model is suitable for the whole family to use, and is also suitable for adults and children with additional needs. For those who are ambulent and able to bounce on their own then the Fit Bounce Pro model is most suitable and there is a stability bar that can be purchased to offer some balance support. For those with physical disabilities or who require physical support to help them bounce then the Fit Bounce Pro XL model is most suitable and there is also a stability bar that can be purchased for additional support. When bouncing on a metal sprung rebounder there will always be a little noise as the mat springs hook into the rebounder rim so you have “metal on metal”. This noise can be kept to a minimum by lubricating the springs from time to time with vaseline or coconut oil. It is not a loud noise, and you will be bouncing to music so providing you can crank the music up you will be fine with a metal sprung unit. A bungee model is super quiet when you bounce so is very suitable for those who like to bounce without music, or who wish to bounce in rooms where there are others nearby. Bouncing is often used for relaxation/holistic purposes so if this is your need then we would recommend any of our bungee models. As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. The Pro Gym non-folding rebounder is used by physiotherapists around the world and in many NHS hospitals for injury rehabilitation and to improve posture. This model provides firm support and a stability bar is available should this be needed as a balance aid in the early days of rehab. As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. For some medical conditions, for example osteo-arthritis, lymphodaema, osteoporosis, cancer, or any other condition where lymphatic drainage is the primary benefit you are looking to realise, then we would recommend a bungee rebounder. This softer bounce is more comfortable for these conditions and provides a very efficient lymphatic drainage. Metal sprung rebounders could still be used but it is a personal preference and depends on degree of the conditions as to which you prefer. For example, if you only have mild swelling/water retention then the metal sprung models are fine. However, if you are not going to bounce at 130bpm then the bungee models are suggested. All of our models are built to a high specification using quality components ensuring years of use. After the warranty period we have a spare parts service where each component can be individually replaced giving a long life. The same cannot be said of all other manufacturers. The key features of our metal sprung rebounders can be summarised as:  HIIT Bounce Pro: entry level model, quarter-folding and also can be used on an incline, comes with stability bar, weighted gloves and HIIT & Incline workouts on DVD, suitable for sports training Maximus Pro: the complete home gym package, quarter-folding, comes with bouncecounter, stability bar, sand weights, resistance bands, carry bag for storage and workouts on DVD, suitable for home users and PTs/Athletes to transport easily Pro Gym: for commercial use & home; non-folding, comes with stability bar, resistance bands and workouts on DVD, suitable for home users, group exercise, physiotherapists and fitness professionals All of our models are built to a high specification using quality components ensuring years of use. After the 12 month warranty period we offer a spare parts service where each component can be individually replaced giving a long life. The same cannot be said of all other manufacturers. The key features of our bungee sprung rebounders can be summarised as:  Fit Bounce Pro: entry level package, quiet bounce, half-folding, easy to store, comes with bouncecounter, carry/storage bag, workouts on DVD, suitable for adult/child use complete beginner through to advanced levels Fit Boucne Pro XL: flarger mat surface, half-folding, comes with bouncecounter, carry/storage bag, workouts on DVD, suitable for those who prefer a larger bouncing surface, adults/child use and those with additional needs Customer Serviceservice@rebound.fitnessTel:+44 (0) 333 444 0846Tel:001 (262) 217 0846 Media Enquiries:service@rebound.fitness   Website byWe Are Flamingo|Privacy Policy|Terms & Conditions © 2025 Rebound Fitness.

Equipment FAQ Bungee or Spring Rebounder – What is the difference? By Heather Moore No Comments Home » Bungee or Spring Rebounder – What is the difference? We often get asked by customers about whether to choose a metal sprung rebounder or a bungee sprung rebounder. The simple answer is that both models have a place in the world of Rebounding and often it’s down to personal preference and budget. Before going into the different experiences you will have on these style rebounders, its important to note that with both designs to get the best experience, the best results, and the best longevity of use then choose a high quality premium rebounder that is designed and built to the top quality specification needed to bounce safely and effectively using high quality individual components. Also buy from a Company who can support you locally with expertise, warranty services and post-warranty spare parts. There are many cheap rebounders (we usually refer to these as mini-trampolines or trampettes) on the market that are really little more than a “toy” and you often find that the individual components cannot be replaced so if the mat wears out then the unit has to be disposed of. The key indicators to watch out for are: Height of rebounder : needs to be >9in off the ground to get the right bounce Weight of rebounder : needs to be >10kgs otherwise the rebounder is unstable to bounce on for rebounding workouts Location of supplier : ensure local customer service & warehouse to get best support Expertise of company : are they a generalist catalogue company, or knowledgeable in rebounding Track Records of company and products : do they have outstanding customer reviews for their product range and customer service. Do they support customers well even when things don’t go to plan? Test Certificates : do they have UK/EU/USA test certificates Don’t be put off Rebounding by trying this awesome exercise on sub-standard equipment! Here are a few considerations when selecting your rebounder. If you are still undecided then please do contact us to speak with our experts who will be very happy to assist you. The below is specific to our Rebound Fitness products but most you can apply to models from other manufacturers alongside the general considerations outlined above. What do you want to use the rebounder for? METAL SPRUNG If the answer is pure fitness and sports training then it’s probable that a metal sprung unit will suit your needs as long as it is well built, well sprung and has quality component parts. Our Rebound Fitness range of spring designed rebounders are perfect for this use. A metal sprung unit will give you a quicker return meaning you will be able to bounce faster as the upward propulsion is quicker (due to the rebounder being sprung at a medium to firmer tension ) and if you are bouncing at a faster tempo say 130pm + which is normal for mainstream fitness rebound classes/workouts then the metal sprung unit is ideal. BUNGEE SPRUNG If you want to use it for holistic bouncing/training or for slower and even straight leg bouncing (a bit like on a trampoline but obviously not so high) then it is likely that a good quality Bungee sprung rebounder is a better option for you. The bungee sprung unit gives a slower upward return so its very hard trying to complete workouts at a faster tempo as the bounce is slower and softer. You can still use the bungee sprung rebounder for fitness training. It is perfect for the beginner (who will bounce to a slower than 130bpm beat) or the advanced exerciser who will work harder as it takes more effort to propel upwards! Who is using the rebounder? METAL SPRUNG If it is for adult use only then the metal sprung and the bungee sprung models are suitable. Each model comes with different accessories so take these into consideration when choosing the model that is best for you. If you want the rebounder for use by children, then please see our basic bounce video at the end of the blog. The most important thing is that the child can bounce with the correct technique, and not “jump” with straight legs like you would on a trampoline. If you feel that they are more likely to jump then we recommend the bungee model (otherwise it places strain on the mat springs which may break). Play Video BUNGEE SPRUNG The bungee model is suitable for the whole family to use, and is also suitable for adults and children with additional needs. For those who are ambulent and able to bounce on their own then the Fit Bounce Pro model is most suitable and there is a stability bar that can be purchased to offer some balance support. For those with physical disabilities or who require physical support to help them bounce then the Fit Bounce Pro XL model is most suitable and there is also a stability bar that can be purchased for additional support. Where is the rebounder being used? METAL SPRUNG When bouncing on a metal sprung rebounder there will always be a little noise as the mat springs hook into the rebounder rim so you have “metal on metal”. This noise can be kept to a minimum by lubricating the springs from time to time with vaseline or coconut oil. It is not a loud noise, and you will be bouncing to music so providing you can crank the music up you will be fine with a metal sprung unit. BUNGEE SPRUNG A bungee model is super quiet when you bounce so is very suitable for those who like to bounce without music, or who wish to bounce in rooms where there are others nearby. Bouncing is often used for relaxation/holistic purposes so if this is your need then we would recommend any of our bungee models. Are there any medical conditions? METAL SPRUNG As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. The Pro Gym non-folding rebounder is used by physiotherapists around the world and in many NHS hospitals for injury rehabilitation and to improve posture. This model provides firm support and a stability bar is available should this be needed as a balance aid in the early days of rehab. BUNGEE SPRUNG As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. For some medical conditions, for example osteo-arthritis, lymphodaema, osteoporosis, cancer, or any other condition where lymphatic drainage is the primary benefit you are looking to realise, then we would recommend a bungee rebounder. This softer bounce is more comfortable for these conditions and provides a very efficient lymphatic drainage. Metal sprung rebounders could still be used but it is a personal preference and depends on degree of the conditions as to which you prefer. For example, if you only have mild swelling/water retention then the metal sprung models are fine. However, if you are not going to bounce at 130bpm then the bungee models are suggested. How much do you want to spend? METAL SPRUNG All of our models are built to a high specification using quality components ensuring years of use.

For example, if you only have mild swelling/water retention then the metal sprung models are fine. However, if you are not going to bounce at 130bpm then the bungee models are suggested.

Search Search Categories Rebound Therapy In the Press Equipment FAQ Benefits of Rebounding Weight Loss Back to all blogs We often get asked by customers about whether to choose a metal sprung rebounder or a bungee sprung rebounder. The simple answer is that both models have a place in the world of Rebounding and often it’s down to personal preference and budget. Before going into the different experiences you will have on these style rebounders, its important to note that with both designs to get the best experience, the best results, and the best longevity of use then choose a high quality premium rebounder that is designed and built to the top quality specification needed to bounce safely and effectively using high quality individual components. Also buy from a Company who can support you locally with expertise, warranty services and post-warranty spare parts. There are many cheap rebounders (we usually refer to these as mini-trampolines or trampettes) on the market that are really little more than a “toy” and you often find that the individual components cannot be replaced so if the mat wears out then the unit has to be disposed of. The key indicators to watch out for are: Height of rebounder : needs to be >9in off the ground to get the right bounce Weight of rebounder : needs to be >10kgs otherwise the rebounder is unstable to bounce on for rebounding workouts Location of supplier : ensure local customer service & warehouse to get best support Expertise of company : are they a generalist catalogue company, or knowledgeable in rebounding Track Records of company and products : do they have outstanding customer reviews for their product range and customer service. Do they support customers well even when things don’t go to plan? Test Certificates : do they have UK/EU/USA test certificates Don’t be put off Rebounding by trying this awesome exercise on sub-standard equipment! Here are a few considerations when selecting your rebounder. If you are still undecided then please do contact us to speak with our experts who will be very happy to assist you. The below is specific to our Rebound Fitness products but most you can apply to models from other manufacturers alongside the general considerations outlined above. What do you want to use the rebounder for? METAL SPRUNG If the answer is pure fitness and sports training then it’s probable that a metal sprung unit will suit your needs as long as it is well built, well sprung and has quality component parts. Our Rebound Fitness range of spring designed rebounders are perfect for this use. A metal sprung unit will give you a quicker return meaning you will be able to bounce faster as the upward propulsion is quicker (due to the rebounder being sprung at a medium to firmer tension ) and if you are bouncing at a faster tempo say 130pm + which is normal for mainstream fitness rebound classes/workouts then the metal sprung unit is ideal. BUNGEE SPRUNG If you want to use it for holistic bouncing/training or for slower and even straight leg bouncing (a bit like on a trampoline but obviously not so high) then it is likely that a good quality Bungee sprung rebounder is a better option for you. The bungee sprung unit gives a slower upward return so its very hard trying to complete workouts at a faster tempo as the bounce is slower and softer. You can still use the bungee sprung rebounder for fitness training. It is perfect for the beginner (who will bounce to a slower than 130bpm beat) or the advanced exerciser who will work harder as it takes more effort to propel upwards! Who is using the rebounder? METAL SPRUNG If it is for adult use only then the metal sprung and the bungee sprung models are suitable. Each model comes with different accessories so take these into consideration when choosing the model that is best for you. If you want the rebounder for use by children, then please see our basic bounce video at the end of the blog. The most important thing is that the child can bounce with the correct technique, and not “jump” with straight legs like you would on a trampoline. If you feel that they are more likely to jump then we recommend the bungee model (otherwise it places strain on the mat springs which may break). Play Video BUNGEE SPRUNG The bungee model is suitable for the whole family to use, and is also suitable for adults and children with additional needs. For those who are ambulent and able to bounce on their own then the Fit Bounce Pro model is most suitable and there is a stability bar that can be purchased to offer some balance support. For those with physical disabilities or who require physical support to help them bounce then the Fit Bounce Pro XL model is most suitable and there is also a stability bar that can be purchased for additional support. Where is the rebounder being used? METAL SPRUNG When bouncing on a metal sprung rebounder there will always be a little noise as the mat springs hook into the rebounder rim so you have “metal on metal”. This noise can be kept to a minimum by lubricating the springs from time to time with vaseline or coconut oil. It is not a loud noise, and you will be bouncing to music so providing you can crank the music up you will be fine with a metal sprung unit. BUNGEE SPRUNG A bungee model is super quiet when you bounce so is very suitable for those who like to bounce without music, or who wish to bounce in rooms where there are others nearby. Bouncing is often used for relaxation/holistic purposes so if this is your need then we would recommend any of our bungee models. Are there any medical conditions? METAL SPRUNG As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. The Pro Gym non-folding rebounder is used by physiotherapists around the world and in many NHS hospitals for injury rehabilitation and to improve posture. This model provides firm support and a stability bar is available should this be needed as a balance aid in the early days of rehab. BUNGEE SPRUNG As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. For some medical conditions, for example osteo-arthritis, lymphodaema, osteoporosis, cancer, or any other condition where lymphatic drainage is the primary benefit you are looking to realise, then we would recommend a bungee rebounder.

Before going into the different experiences you will have on these style rebounders, its important to note that with both designs to get the best experience, the best results, and the best longevity of use then choose a high quality premium rebounder that is designed and built to the top quality specification needed to bounce safely and effectively using high quality individual components. Also buy from a Company who can support you locally with expertise, warranty services and post-warranty spare parts. There are many cheap rebounders (we usually refer to these as mini-trampolines or trampettes) on the market that are really little more than a “toy” and you often find that the individual components cannot be replaced so if the mat wears out then the unit has to be disposed of. The key indicators to watch out for are: Height of rebounder : needs to be >9in off the ground to get the right bounce Weight of rebounder : needs to be >10kgs otherwise the rebounder is unstable to bounce on for rebounding workouts Location of supplier : ensure local customer service & warehouse to get best support Expertise of company : are they a generalist catalogue company, or knowledgeable in rebounding Track Records of company and products : do they have outstanding customer reviews for their product range and customer service. Do they support customers well even when things don’t go to plan? Test Certificates : do they have UK/EU/USA test certificates Don’t be put off Rebounding by trying this awesome exercise on sub-standard equipment! Here are a few considerations when selecting your rebounder. If you are still undecided then please do contact us to speak with our experts who will be very happy to assist you. The below is specific to our Rebound Fitness products but most you can apply to models from other manufacturers alongside the general considerations outlined above. What do you want to use the rebounder for? METAL SPRUNG If the answer is pure fitness and sports training then it’s probable that a metal sprung unit will suit your needs as long as it is well built, well sprung and has quality component parts. Our Rebound Fitness range of spring designed rebounders are perfect for this use. A metal sprung unit will give you a quicker return meaning you will be able to bounce faster as the upward propulsion is quicker (due to the rebounder being sprung at a medium to firmer tension ) and if you are bouncing at a faster tempo say 130pm + which is normal for mainstream fitness rebound classes/workouts then the metal sprung unit is ideal. BUNGEE SPRUNG If you want to use it for holistic bouncing/training or for slower and even straight leg bouncing (a bit like on a trampoline but obviously not so high) then it is likely that a good quality Bungee sprung rebounder is a better option for you. The bungee sprung unit gives a slower upward return so its very hard trying to complete workouts at a faster tempo as the bounce is slower and softer. You can still use the bungee sprung rebounder for fitness training. It is perfect for the beginner (who will bounce to a slower than 130bpm beat) or the advanced exerciser who will work harder as it takes more effort to propel upwards! Who is using the rebounder? METAL SPRUNG If it is for adult use only then the metal sprung and the bungee sprung models are suitable. Each model comes with different accessories so take these into consideration when choosing the model that is best for you. If you want the rebounder for use by children, then please see our basic bounce video at the end of the blog. The most important thing is that the child can bounce with the correct technique, and not “jump” with straight legs like you would on a trampoline. If you feel that they are more likely to jump then we recommend the bungee model (otherwise it places strain on the mat springs which may break). Play Video BUNGEE SPRUNG The bungee model is suitable for the whole family to use, and is also suitable for adults and children with additional needs. For those who are ambulent and able to bounce on their own then the Fit Bounce Pro model is most suitable and there is a stability bar that can be purchased to offer some balance support. For those with physical disabilities or who require physical support to help them bounce then the Fit Bounce Pro XL model is most suitable and there is also a stability bar that can be purchased for additional support. Where is the rebounder being used? METAL SPRUNG When bouncing on a metal sprung rebounder there will always be a little noise as the mat springs hook into the rebounder rim so you have “metal on metal”. This noise can be kept to a minimum by lubricating the springs from time to time with vaseline or coconut oil. It is not a loud noise, and you will be bouncing to music so providing you can crank the music up you will be fine with a metal sprung unit. BUNGEE SPRUNG A bungee model is super quiet when you bounce so is very suitable for those who like to bounce without music, or who wish to bounce in rooms where there are others nearby. Bouncing is often used for relaxation/holistic purposes so if this is your need then we would recommend any of our bungee models. Are there any medical conditions? METAL SPRUNG As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. The Pro Gym non-folding rebounder is used by physiotherapists around the world and in many NHS hospitals for injury rehabilitation and to improve posture. This model provides firm support and a stability bar is available should this be needed as a balance aid in the early days of rehab. BUNGEE SPRUNG As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. For some medical conditions, for example osteo-arthritis, lymphodaema, osteoporosis, cancer, or any other condition where lymphatic drainage is the primary benefit you are looking to realise, then we would recommend a bungee rebounder. This softer bounce is more comfortable for these conditions and provides a very efficient lymphatic drainage. Metal sprung rebounders could still be used but it is a personal preference and depends on degree of the conditions as to which you prefer. For example, if you only have mild swelling/water retention then the metal sprung models are fine. However, if you are not going to bounce at 130bpm then the bungee models are suggested.

Play Video Play Video BUNGEE SPRUNG The bungee model is suitable for the whole family to use, and is also suitable for adults and children with additional needs. For those who are ambulent and able to bounce on their own then the Fit Bounce Pro model is most suitable and there is a stability bar that can be purchased to offer some balance support. For those with physical disabilities or who require physical support to help them bounce then the Fit Bounce Pro XL model is most suitable and there is also a stability bar that can be purchased for additional support.

METAL SPRUNG When bouncing on a metal sprung rebounder there will always be a little noise as the mat springs hook into the rebounder rim so you have “metal on metal”. This noise can be kept to a minimum by lubricating the springs from time to time with vaseline or coconut oil. It is not a loud noise, and you will be bouncing to music so providing you can crank the music up you will be fine with a metal sprung unit. BUNGEE SPRUNG A bungee model is super quiet when you bounce so is very suitable for those who like to bounce without music, or who wish to bounce in rooms where there are others nearby. Bouncing is often used for relaxation/holistic purposes so if this is your need then we would recommend any of our bungee models.

METAL SPRUNG As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. The Pro Gym non-folding rebounder is used by physiotherapists around the world and in many NHS hospitals for injury rehabilitation and to improve posture. This model provides firm support and a stability bar is available should this be needed as a balance aid in the early days of rehab. BUNGEE SPRUNG As with all exercise regimes, please consult with your medical practitioner before starting to exercise. For some medical conditions, for example osteo-arthritis, lymphodaema, osteoporosis, cancer, or any other condition where lymphatic drainage is the primary benefit you are looking to realise, then we would recommend a bungee rebounder. This softer bounce is more comfortable for these conditions and provides a very efficient lymphatic drainage. Metal sprung rebounders could still be used but it is a personal preference and depends on degree of the conditions as to which you prefer. For example, if you only have mild swelling/water retention then the metal sprung models are fine. However, if you are not going to bounce at 130bpm then the bungee models are suggested.
