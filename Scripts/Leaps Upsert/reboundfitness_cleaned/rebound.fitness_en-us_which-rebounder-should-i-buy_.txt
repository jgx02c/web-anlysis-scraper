The key indicators to watch out for are: Height of rebounder : needs to be >9in off the ground to get the right bounce Weight of rebounder : needs to be >10kgs otherwise the rebounder is unstable to bounce on for rebounding workouts Location of supplier : ensure local customer service & warehouse to get best support Expertise of company : are they a generalist catalogue company, or knowledgeable in rebounding Track Records of company and products : do they have outstanding customer reviews for their product range and customer service. Do they support customers well even when things don’t go to plan? Test Certificates : do they have UK/EU/USA test certificates Bungee or Spring Rebounder We often get asked by customers about whether to choose a metal sprung rebounder or a bungee sprung rebounder. The simple answer is that both models have a place in the world of Rebounding and often it’s down to personal preference and budget. We have a specific blog on the differences between a bungee and spring rebounder so for full information click on the link, but in simple terms: a Bungee rebounder is quieter and has a slower, controlled bounce. It is great for family bouncing, for Children and Young People with SEND needs and for complete beginners or those who are advanced users and want to work harder! a Spring rebounder is great for fitness bouncing to faster tempo music and there will be some noise from the metal springs however this is easily minimised by applying coconut oil / vaseline to the springs from time to time.

By Heather Moore No Comments Home » Which Rebounder should I buy? We often get asked by people which Rebounder will be best for their use. There are many rebounders, mini trampolines and trampettes on the market from a variety of manufacturers and suppliers. There is also a lot of research and publications that speak about the health and fitness benefits of rebounding. It is important to note that in order to get these benefits, and to get the best bounce experience and longevity of equipment, then whichever manufacturer you choose be sure that you are purchasing a high quality product, where all the components are built from high quality materials so that you can bounce safely and effectively. Also buy from a Company who can support you locally with expertise, warranty services and post-warranty spare parts. There are many cheap rebounder on the market that are really little more than a “toy” and you often find that the individual components cannot be replaced so if the mat wears out then the unit has to be disposed of. The key indicators to watch out for are: Height of rebounder : needs to be >9in off the ground to get the right bounce Weight of rebounder : needs to be >10kgs otherwise the rebounder is unstable to bounce on for rebounding workouts Location of supplier : ensure local customer service & warehouse to get best support Expertise of company : are they a generalist catalogue company, or knowledgeable in rebounding Track Records of company and products : do they have outstanding customer reviews for their product range and customer service.
