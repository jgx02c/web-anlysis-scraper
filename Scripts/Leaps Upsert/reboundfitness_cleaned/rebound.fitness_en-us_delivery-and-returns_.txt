    Home»Delivery and Returns We hope you are 100% satisfied with your product and our customer service – we are always here to help. If you have any questions regarding our delivery or returns policy then pleasecontact us. This policy was last updated on January 2019. We make every effort to deliver Goods that are in stock on a next working day service for orders placed before 12 noon, but it can take 5 – 10 working days of the order being placed. We will notify you by way of email when your goods are to be dispatched to you. The message will contain details of estimated delivery times in addition to any reasons for a delay in the delivery of the Goods purchased by you. If you cancel your order and the goods have already been dispatched then you will be liable to pay the shipping charges. Goods are delivered using a third-party courier. They will be delivered between the hours of 9am and 5pm. If you are not going to be at home, you can leave a note giving instructions on where to leave the Goods. Alternatively, the courier will leave a card with a number you can call to arrange re-delivery on a date that is convenient to you. You can also put special instructions when you place the order which we will pass onto the third-party courier. If the courier leaves a card and you do not contact them within 48-hours then we get notified and the Goods are returned to us. You are then liable for any re-delivery costs and if you request a refund then the delivery costs and return costs will be deducted from any refund. If we receive no communication from you, within 10 days of delivery, regarding any problems with the Goods, you are deemed to have received the Goods in full working order and with no problems. Rebound Fitness aims to always provide high quality Goods that are fault free and undamaged. On occasion however, goods may need to be returned. Returns are governed by the Terms and Conditions and are summarised below for your convenience: If you receive Goods which do not match those that you ordered, unless accompanied by an explanatory note detailing the changes, stating reasons for the changes and setting out your options, you should contact us within 10 days to arrange collection and return.  You will be given the option to have the Goods replaced with those ordered (if available) or to be refunded through the payment method used by you when purchasing the Goods. Refunds and replacements will be issued upon our receipt of the returned Goods. If any Goods you have purchased are damaged in transit or have faults when they are delivered to you, you should notify us within 10 days.  If the faults are minor then we will rectify this by providing spare parts where possible.  If the fault is  major you should contact us within 28 days to arrange collection and return. We will pay shipment costs where it is not possible to rectify a fault through provision of spare parts.  If the fault is minor and you wish to return the goods we will refund the original price paid (including shipping) but you are responsible for return shipping costs. Goods must be returned in their original condition with all packaging and documentation. Upon receipt of the returned Goods, the price of the Goods, as paid by you, will be refunded to you through the payment method used by you when purchasing the Goods.

This period begins once your order is complete and ends 14 days after the Goods have been delivered. If you change your mind about the goods within this period, please contact Rebound Fitness to arrange to return the goods within 14 days of receipt. Goods can only be returned for this reason if their packaging remains unopened and the Goods can be re-sold, as new, without any additional work on the part of Rebound Fitness.
