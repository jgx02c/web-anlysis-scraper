Thank you to the anonymous kind soul who purchased the Sunny Health & Fitness Hyperextension Roman Chair from my Amazon Wishlist! 

This will be a huge help in preparing my body for my shoulder reconstruction in January. 

It only took 40 minutes, a dislocated shoulder, a papercut on my hand, and a few cuss words to put it together all on my own!

Granted, Andy will go in and tighten every bolt since my hands can only do so much, but I am genuinely proud of myself for putting the chair together. 

Having this piece of equipment from sunnyhealthfitness in my home will be incredibly useful to build my core backup before my shoulder reconstruction in a few months!

So, in addition to hiking and swimming weekly with my sisters in Islam and my family, I purchased this mini stepper after watching mirabelelume videos. I’m excited to add this in and begin my workout routine. Anyone else stepping at home?

It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:
"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good. Strive for that which will benefit you, seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. If anything befalls you, do not say, "if only I had done such and such" rather say "Qaddara Allahu wa ma sha'a fa'ala (Allah has decreed and whatever he wills, He does)." For (saying) 'If' opens (the door) to the deeds of Satan.'"

It was the room I just threw stuff I didn’t want anymore but didn’t have any place to put. When we decided to get our carpet replaced in the basement, I also decided to make this room useful and turn it into a small home gym. It also gave me a place to finally hang all my DMB posters and now I love this room! The last picture is what the room looked like before (minus all the crap 😂) READ MORE...

Thank you to the anonymous kind soul who purchased the Sunny Health & Fitness Hyperextension Roman Chair from my Amazon Wishlist! 

This will be a huge help in preparing my body for my shoulder reconstruction in January. 

It only took 40 minutes, a dislocated shoulder, a papercut on my hand, and a few cuss words to put it together all on my own!

Granted, Andy will go in and tighten every bolt since my hands can only do so much, but I am genuinely proud of myself for putting the chair together. 

Having this piece of equipment from sunnyhealthfitness in my home will be incredibly useful to build my core backup before my shoulder reconstruction in a few months!
