We advise that you keep your original packaging during this time. Please contact us to request a return or get information about any additional policies that may apply.  Only items in original packaging can be returned. If an item is sent back in non-original packaging, this will immediately void the refund for the customer.

Please note that the return process involves several stages, so please be patient in awaiting your refund.  Generally following the date of arrival at our warehouse, this process is approximately 5 to 10 business days to receive return, inspect, re-stock, issue credit to original form of payment, and for credit/debit card payments for your banking institution to post the refund to your account (in certain instances additional stages are required). Purchases made with credit cards and debit cards are issued back through the same method of payment. Refunds through credit and debit cards usually take up to 7 days but could vary by merchant or banking institution. Full refunds may potentially take a few days up to a few months. Please contact your credit card and/or debit card issuer for more information. If you wish to return a product that came with a free promotional item, the free item must be returned with the original order to receive a full refund. If the promotional item is not returned, you will be refunded the cost of the product minus the full value of the promotional item. Buy One, Get One (BOGO) promo codes: If you wish to return a product that was part of an order where a BOGO promo code was applied, the refund value of the returned product will be calculated as original purchase price reduced by its prorated discount that was applied to the order with the BOGO promo code, in addition to applicable fees as mentioned above. REPLACEMENT PARTS Items sold 'Replacement Parts' are non-returnable, non-refundable and are absent of any product warranty. 'Replacement Parts' items will be clearly identified and marked as such on the product page prior to purchase. DIGITAL PRODUCTS Digital products, such as E-books, are ineligible for refunds once the order is confirmed. We recommend contacting us for assistance if you experience issues with receiving or downloading any digital products. Email us: support@sunnyhealthfitness.com . ORDERS RETURNED WITHOUT DELIVERY (REFUSING DELIVERY) If an order is returned as undeliverable due to incorrect shipping address or non-availability of recipient to accept delivery (in cases where we require signature confirmation) or due to refusal to accept shipment, it shall be considered as a return by 'customer error (buyer's remorse)' and our standard Return Policy is applicable on such orders. In addition to the restocking fees, the actual Shipping & Handling charges for outbound and return shipping are chargeable to your account. LTL FREIGHT SHIPPING For any item that was shipped via LTL freight, there will be a return shipping fee of $200 plus any other applicable fee as listed in our policy. Due to the size and weight of the product, we do not offer a refund for any shipping or delivery charges you may have paid to receive your product. Returning your item may incur additional charges for damage caused by improper use, misassembly, or accidents. If the item has shipped and you want to cancel the order, even if you have not received it, the return shipping and restocking fees above will apply. Returns of unused and unopened items are accepted within 30 days of purchase date, with the exception of 'As Is' items & Replacement Parts (see below). We advise that you keep your original packaging during this time. Please contact us to request a return or get information about any additional policies that may apply. RETURNS PACKAGING & ITS CONDITION WHEN SENDING BACK Only items in original packaging can be returned. If an item is sent back in non-original packaging, this will immediately void the refund for the customer. Unfortunately, we cannot provide replacement boxes. Every customer will receive this notice in their Order Confirmation Email and their Shipping Confirmation Email to hold onto their packaging for the first 30 days. Please be respectful of your returned item(s) when sending it back to us. We take great care in making sure your item is properly boxed/packaged and secure for transit, we expect the same from you on your return(s). All returns are inspected upon arrival. If the item arrives back damaged due to customer poorly boxing/packing your returned item, this will affect your refund amount. Severely damaged goods arriving back to us due to poor customer boxing/packaging may even result in getting no refund at all. RETURN SHIPPING COSTS – WHO PAYS? When Sunny Health & Fitness Pays For Return Shipping Sunny Health & Fitness will pay for the cost of return shipping if the reason for return was result of OUR error. Examples of instances may include: Item arrived defective and cannot be fixed with a replacement part We shipped out the wrong item # We shipped it to the wrong address We shipped a duplicate order Item malfunctioned during the 30 day returns period (Assuming the customer assembled the item properly per the instruction manual) IMPORTANT: For items that arrive damaged or is defective, YOU MUST provide video/photos to support your claim that the item arrived damaged or is malfunctioning. If a customer refuses to or failure to send photos/video of a claimed malfunctioning/damaged item, this return will be treated as "buyer’s remorse" and the customer is solely responsible for shipping it back. The customer is also vulnerable to the 15% restocking fee as well as any shipping charges the seller has paid out. If a customer claims an item is defective/damaged, the customer must provide proof prior to return, no exceptions. Use the Contact Us form to submit pics/videos for your return request. Once we have received the approved returned item, we will review its condition. If the item is found to be defective, we will issue the refund. If the return request for a damaged/defective item can be fixed with simple parts and support, we can provide the option of free replacement part(s) and advice on how to repair your item if the customer finds that to be the easier solution so you don't have to fuss with shipping a large bulky item back. Also note, we do not send out technicians or repairmen to customer homes. When the Customer Pays For Return Shipping In the case of a return due to customer error, return shipping is the customer’s responsibility and shipping charges are paid by customer. Pre-paid return shipping labels are not provided in these instances. It is important to note that original shipping and handling costs will be deducted from your total refund, and any order offered with special shipping charges is subject to a deduction of our actual outbound shipping costs.  Examples of these customer returns may include: Buyers Remorse ( "Not satisfied with performance", "Item doesn't fit me correctly", "Item doesn't meet my expectations", “I tried it, but I want something else”, etc. ) No Reason / No Longer Want Misinterpretation of Product Description (failure to fully read item details/descriptions/features) Order Cancellation after the item already shipped out, even if you have not yet received the item Customer bought the wrong one Customer accidentally bought too many Customer accidentally provided wrong shipping address After the 30 day returns period, customers may use the items Sunny manufacturers product warranty period for repairs if the item is faulty or malfunctioning. Please see the manufacturers product warranty for details. For any item that was shipped via LTL freight, there will be a return shipping fee of $200 plus any other applicable fee as listed in our policy. Please see details below.
