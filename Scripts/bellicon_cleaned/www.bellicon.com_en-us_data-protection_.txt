If you have any questions about data protection or want to exercise rights or claims with regard to your personal data, please contact us by email atinfo@bellicon.de. For the protection of your inquiries by Internet form we use the service reCAPTCHA offered by Google Inc. The inquiry serves the differentiation whether the input takes place by humans or abusively by automated, mechanical processing. The query includes the transmission of the IP address and any other data required by Google for the service reCAPTCHA to Google. For this purpose your input will be transmitted to Google and used there. However, your IP address will be shortened by Google in advance within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of this service. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of reCAPTCHA is not merged with other data from Google. These data are subject to the differing data protection regulations of Google. For more information about Google's privacy policy, please visit:https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/. You can find an opt-out option at the following link:https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated. For faster and more efficient processing of customer inquiries we use the ticket system "Zendesk", a customer service platform of Zendesk Inc., 989 Market Street #300, San Francisco, CA 94102. We also use the solution Zendesk Guide as a knowledge database for the FAQ available to you. If it’s required to process your inquiry, data like for example your surname, first name, address, telephone number, e-mail address are collected and processed. The legal basis for the processing of your data is our legitimate interest in a fast and efficient processing of your inquiries in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. f) GDPR.

Cloudflare operates a content delivery network (CDN) and provides protection functions for the website (web application firewall). For this purpose, the data transfer between the requesting browser and our server is decrypted by Cloudflare to prevent attacks such as so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on our software. The legal basis is the protection of legitimate interests, namely the prevention of attacks on our website pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. f. GDPR Insofar as a transfer of your data to the USA takes place, this is done on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 49 para. 1 cl.1 lit. a GDPR In addition, Cloudflare has committed to us under a standard contractual clause that in third countries outside the EU to which data is exported, a level of data protection equivalent to that in the EU is guaranteed.

MailChimp is a service which inter alia enables the organisation and dispatch of newsletters. When you input data for the purpose of receiving newsletters (e.g. your email address), these are stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. With the help of MailChimp, we are able to analyse our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email that has been sent by MailChimp, a file contained in the email (so-called web-beacon) establishes a connection to the servers of MailChimp in the USA. Thus, it is possible to determine whether a newsletter message was opened and which links, if any, were clicked. Moreover, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of retrieval, IP-address, browser type and operating system). We are not able to attribute this information to the respective recipients of the newsletters. They exclusively serve the purpose of statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. We can use the results of these analyses to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients. If you do not wish any analysis by MailChimp, you need to unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a relevant link in each newsletter message. The data processing is performed on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR), which you can revoke at any time. The lawfulness of the data processing procedures that have already taken place remains unaffected by such revocation. The data stored by you with us for the purpose of receiving newsletters remain stored by us until your deregistration from the newsletter and will be deleted from both our servers and from the servers of MailChimp after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data, which have been stored by us for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the member section), remain unaffected thereby. For more details, you may wish to consult the data privacy provisions of MailChimp athttps://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/. The recipient of the collected data is MailChimp. If your data is transferred to the USA, this is done on the basis of your consent in accordance with Art. 49 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. a GDPR. In addition, MailChimp is obligated to us by way of a standard contractual clause that a level of data protection equivalent to that of the EU is guaranteed in third countries outside the EU to which the collected data is exported. We have concluded a so-called "Data Processing Agreement" with MailChimp, in which we obligate MailChimp to protect the data of our customers and not to disclose them to any third parties. i) Tracify We use the web analytics service Tracify on our website or on parts of our website to record how our website is used by its visitors and to evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of our advertising/marketing measures.

MailChimp is a service which inter alia enables the organisation and dispatch of newsletters. When you input data for the purpose of receiving newsletters (e.g. your email address), these are stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. With the help of MailChimp, we are able to analyse our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email that has been sent by MailChimp, a file contained in the email (so-called web-beacon) establishes a connection to the servers of MailChimp in the USA. Thus, it is possible to determine whether a newsletter message was opened and which links, if any, were clicked. Moreover, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of retrieval, IP-address, browser type and operating system). We are not able to attribute this information to the respective recipients of the newsletters. They exclusively serve the purpose of statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. We can use the results of these analyses to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients. If you do not wish any analysis by MailChimp, you need to unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a relevant link in each newsletter message. The data processing is performed on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR), which you can revoke at any time. The lawfulness of the data processing procedures that have already taken place remains unaffected by such revocation. The data stored by you with us for the purpose of receiving newsletters remain stored by us until your deregistration from the newsletter and will be deleted from both our servers and from the servers of MailChimp after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data, which have been stored by us for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the member section), remain unaffected thereby. For more details, you may wish to consult the data privacy provisions of MailChimp at https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/ . The recipient of the collected data is MailChimp. If your data is transferred to the USA, this is done on the basis of your consent in accordance with Art. 49 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. a GDPR. In addition, MailChimp is obligated to us by way of a standard contractual clause that a level of data protection equivalent to that of the EU is guaranteed in third countries outside the EU to which the collected data is exported. We have concluded a so-called "Data Processing Agreement" with MailChimp, in which we obligate MailChimp to protect the data of our customers and not to disclose them to any third parties. i) Tracify We use the web analytics service Tracify on our website or on parts of our website to record how our website is used by its visitors and to evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of our advertising/marketing measures.

The information transmitted to Tracify is completely and irreversibly anonymized immediately after transmission, so that a personal reference is excluded.
