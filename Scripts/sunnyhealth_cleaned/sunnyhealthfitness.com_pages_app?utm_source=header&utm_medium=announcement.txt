Shop Ready-to-Connect Equipment -Learn More The SunnyFit App is available in both iOS and Android versions and can be download in the app stores. Yes, it will! The current version of the app is created and optimized for handheld phones/devices at this time, but will function normally with on an iPad / Android tablet. The iPad/Android tablet-specific versions are currently under development and will be released on a later date. In theSunnyFitapp, you will find a rapidly expanding library of workout courses to exercise to – with or without Sunny-branded exercise equipment. Take the app outdoors with or without an audio workout course and track your outdoor walks/runs/bike-rides. The app can help you create a customized training plan to focus on a certain piece of exercise equipment, or a plan that focuses on specific goals like distance travelled or calories burned per session. You can also embark on the World Tour mode, where you can work out to scenic  routes from all around the world on your indoor bike, treadmill, or rower. If you like competition, you can take on the world tour and simulated route challenges to see how you fare amongst similarly minded community members. All users are encouraged to engage in theSunnyFitcommunity while participating in various activities available on the app. Non-Sunny equipment isnotofficially supported by theSunnyFit – For Home Fitnessapp at this time. TheSunnyFit Bike Cadencesensor, however, can technically be used to connect any indoor/outdoor bike to the app for stat tracking. TheSunnyFit Bike Cadencesensor, when used with theSunnyFit – For Home Fitness appin Indoor “Cadence” Mode, will allow for additional information like RPM, height, and weight to help make workout calculations more accurate than a standard bike exercise meter. The Cadence sensor can be toggled to Outdoor “Speed” Mode for use on outdoor bikes with theSunnyFitapp. The app will track these results from each workout session so you can use that data and decide to keep your current pace or to further optimize your routine. SunnyFit – For HomeFitnessis a brand-new fitness app that will replace the old appSUNNY HEALTH & FITNESS.SunnyFittakes everything learned from the old app and greatly improves upon nearly every aspect including presentation, user-friendliness, and of course- the free workout courses and programs within the app! Unfortunately, no. The newSunnyFit – For Home Fitnessapp was completely rebuilt from the ground up to give users the best and smoothest experience possible. This means that the entire underlying software architecture of the app needed to be revamped, including the login system. However, to show our appreciation for already being part of the Sunny family, users that registers for a newSunnyFitaccount using the old account’s email/phone number will receive a returning user in-app care package in the near future. Unfortunately, no. Similar to the login system, the workout data and its related systems were revamped with the rest of the underlying software architecture. However, to show our appreciation for already being part of the Sunny family, users that registers for a newSunnyFitaccount using the old account’s email/phone number will receive a returning user in-app care package in the near future. 1. Check if your equipment has Bluetooth functionality for communicating with theSunnyFit – For Home Fitnessapphere.2. Make sure your equipment is securely plugged into an outlet and turned on if applicable. Otherwise, check and/or replace the batteries in the exercise meter to make sure it is in working order.3. Select a course based off your equipment. This will take you to the course detail page and select 'START'.4. From here you will be taken to the ""Prepare"" page. Select your workout equipment on the left-hand side of screen, and it will begin to search for your SMART item.5. Select your equipment's model number to complete the connection, accept any permissions that can pop up beforehand.Note: The app connects to and maintains a Bluetooth connection to compatible equipment throughout the workout’s/activity’s duration. Please follow the in-app instructions if the connection is interrupted/terminated during a workout/activity. 1. In the SunnyFit – For Home Fitness app, go to the “Workout” tab and select a course.2. If the sensor has already been installed on the bike, pedal the bike a few times to activate the Cadence sensor. If it is not installed yet, shake it a few times to achieve the same effect.3. After pressing the 'START' button on the selected course, the app will begin searching for the cadence sensor on the equipment list. Select the cadence sensor and the app will ask you to bind it to a Sunny-branded bike.4. Press “Select” on your bike from the list, then press “Select” once more on the available equipment page to confirm.5. Once you see the bike on the screen as the connected equipment window, that means the Cadence sensor is ready for use on the SunnyFit app!6. Note: The app connects to and maintains a connection to compatible equipment throughout the workout’s/activity’s duration. Please follow the in-app instructions if the connection is interrupted/terminated during a workout/activity. First, please refer to the equipment’s instruction manual to verify if it has Bluetooth capabilities that connects to the SunnyFit app. Some equipment (certain indoor bikes) in our product line has Bluetooth functionality for playing music on the onboard speakers, but not for connecting with the app. Please try the following steps:1. Verify if your phone/device’s Bluetooth function is turned on and try searching again.2. Position the phone/device closer to the equipment you’re trying to connect to and try again.3. Check to see if the exercise equipment is plugged in, turned on, and not in standby/sleep mode.4. If all these steps fail, please contact the SunnyFit support team atsupport@sunnyfit.com. Not at all! In most cases you can choose to watch the workout course videos without connecting  to equipment. Keep in mind that when done this way, the app will not be able to track as many data points as if the equipment is connected. Treadmill workouts will lose the functionality of being able to control the treadmill’s speed and incline from the app during video playback if it is not connected. The Challenge mode and the Indoor Workout - Free Mode are the only modes in theSunnyFit – For Home Fitness app that requires Bluetooth-connected equipment. In the "Workout" tab, you can find a variety of different workouts based of your equipment type. Tap any workout type icon to see full list of courses for that  workout type. Here you can tap on the filter icon on the top right to filter the courses you are seeing with dimensions like: Intensity, Time, Target Area, and more. SunnyFit Levels is a system that quantifies your fitness journey progression on theSunnyFitapp through experience points. SunnyFit Rewards allows you to redeem content with the rewards points you earn from within the app. The full list of redeemable items will be announced on a later date. The “Target Customize” plan lets you create a custom plan and set a training goal for up to 4 weeks. This mode is compatible with all BT-supported equipment workouts and outdoor running. The “AI Recommendation” plan lets theSunnyFitapp recommend workout courses based on the answers you provide. You can select up to 6 workout courses from the recommendations and choose the weekdays you want to work out on for up to 4 weeks. You can check your previous workout sessions from the “Home” tab and tapping on the "Workout Overview" and selecting  the “History” option. Here you will see a record of every workout session you did in the day, week, month, or year. Here you can check the workout results of each individual workout by tapping on the session from the list.

About SunnyFit® Learn More About SunnyFit® Learn More About SunnyFit® Learn More About SunnyFit® About the SunnyFit App Is SunnyFit - For Home Fitness compatible with my phone? plus minus The SunnyFit App is available in both iOS and Android versions and can be download in the app stores. Will the SunnyFit - For Home Fitness app work on my iPad / Android tablet? plus minus Yes, it will! The current version of the app is created and optimized for handheld phones/devices at this time, but will function normally with on an iPad / Android tablet. The iPad/Android tablet-specific versions are currently under development and will be released on a later date. What are few things that I can do in the SunnyFit – For Home Fitness app? plus minus In the SunnyFit app, you will find a rapidly expanding library of workout courses to exercise to – with or without Sunny-branded exercise equipment. Take the app outdoors with or without an audio workout course and track your outdoor walks/runs/bike-rides. The app can help you create a customized training plan to focus on a certain piece of exercise equipment, or a plan that focuses on specific goals like distance travelled or calories burned per session. You can also embark on the World Tour mode, where you can work out to scenic  routes from all around the world on your indoor bike, treadmill, or rower. If you like competition, you can take on the world tour and simulated route challenges to see how you fare amongst similarly minded community members. All users are encouraged to engage in the SunnyFit community while participating in various activities available on the app. Is the SunnyFit – For Home Fitness app compatible with exercise equipment that’s not from Sunny Health & Fitness? plus minus Non-Sunny equipment is not officially supported by the SunnyFit – For Home Fitness app at this time. The SunnyFit Bike Cadence sensor, however, can technically be used to connect any indoor/outdoor bike to the app for stat tracking. Why should I use a SunnyFit Bike Cadence sensor if my indoor bike already has an onboard exercise meter? plus minus The SunnyFit Bike Cadence sensor, when used with the SunnyFit – For Home Fitness app in Indoor “Cadence” Mode, will allow for additional information like RPM, height, and weight to help make workout calculations more accurate than a standard bike exercise meter. The Cadence sensor can be toggled to Outdoor “Speed” Mode for use on outdoor bikes with the SunnyFit app. The app will track these results from each workout session so you can use that data and decide to keep your current pace or to further optimize your routine. What is the difference between the new app SunnyFit - For Home Fitness and the old app SUNNY HEALTH & FITNESS ? plus minus SunnyFit – For Home Fitness is a brand-new fitness app that will replace the old app SUNNY HEALTH & FITNESS . SunnyFit takes everything learned from the old app and greatly improves upon nearly every aspect including presentation, user-friendliness, and of course- the free workout courses and programs within the app! Can I use my old account info from SUNNY HEALTH & FITNESS to log in to the new app SunnyFit – For Home Fitness ? plus minus Unfortunately, no. The new SunnyFit – For Home Fitness app was completely rebuilt from the ground up to give users the best and smoothest experience possible. This means that the entire underlying software architecture of the app needed to be revamped, including the login system. However, to show our appreciation for already being part of the Sunny family, users that registers for a new SunnyFit account using the old account’s email/phone number will receive a returning user in-app care package in the near future. Will I be able to carry the workout data from the old app SUNNY HEALTH & FITNESS over into the new app SunnyFit – At Home Fitness ? plus minus Unfortunately, no. Similar to the login system, the workout data and its related systems were revamped with the rest of the underlying software architecture. However, to show our appreciation for already being part of the Sunny family, users that registers for a new SunnyFit account using the old account’s email/phone number will receive a returning user in-app care package in the near future.
