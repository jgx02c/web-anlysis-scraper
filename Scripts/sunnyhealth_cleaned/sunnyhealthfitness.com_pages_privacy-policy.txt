We encourage you to carefully review this Policy regarding the collection, use and treatment of your information. By using, accessing, or registering with the App, you consent to our collection, use, processing, and disclosure of information in accordance with this Policy. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how third-parties, vendors, and service providers collect or use your information. Certain regions or locations have specific information concerning privacy related information. For California residents, please refer to Attachment “A” and for European residents, please see Attachment “B” for additional notices and privacy disclosures applicable to you.  This Policy applies to information you provide to us or that we collect automatically when you register, visit, access or use the App and when you interact with the App or with App content or applications that may link to or be accessible from or on the App that are provided or managed by a third party. Unless otherwise covered by another primary policy, this Policy also extends to our forums, social media channels, blogs and similar media platforms. However, this Policy does not apply to information we collect when you visit or use any external website or when you communicate with us through email, text or other such ancillary electronic means. For information regarding how we collect and use information when you visit or use Sunny’s website or communicate with us through email, text, or other electronic means, including web-based pages, please refer to our Website privacy policy. This Policy informs you of the following:  When you visit or use our App, we may collect, process or receive information about you as described in this Policy. The App may include links to other websites or platforms, including third party managed pages. For example, the App may provide a link to a web page providing product information or a third party managed web page concerning health and exercise information and resources. If you navigate to such websites, then those external website privacy policies thereby govern the collection of information while you use, view and/or interact on such sites. We may process and use your information for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect or receive the information, or for any lawful basis or otherwise subject to your consent. 4.1 Third Party Providers.The App, its related components or functions may be provided, developed or hosted by third parties that are not necessarily affiliated with Sunny. These entities may receive, collect and/or process information you provide within the App, including information about your use of the App and your activities over time and across third party applications or websites. These third parties may also collect, use, store, process and/or transmit information in accordance with their applicable privacy policies and business practices, which are not under Sunny’s control. For more information on third party practices, please refer to such third parties’ applicable privacy policies, terms of use, end user license agreements, or similar disclosures, available from such third party’s website or by contacting the third party for more information. 4.2 Links to External Websites. The App may include links to external websites not operated or controlled by Sunny. For example, the App may link to a third party website that allows you to submit your information in order to receive health, exercise or lifestyle related content. Please be aware that Sunny does not have control of and is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of such other sites. We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each website that you visit and be careful as to the information you may submit to any such third party. 4.3 Social Media Networks.Sunny maintains a presence on various third party social media sites. However, Sunny does not control and is not responsible for the collection, tracking, use, or disclosure of your information gathered through social media applications or websites or profiles within other applications, or otherwise as a result of your participation in social media platforms. Third party social networking applications and advertisers on such applications, including on the Sunny pages or profiles within those sites, are not obligated to follow or apply this Policy or the Terms of Use. You should directly contact the applicable social media platform provider and refer to their applicable privacy policies if you have any related questions or concerns as to use of those applications. 3.4 Tracking Technologies.The App may use systematic data collection technologies including cookies (a data file saved by a website onto the user’s device that shares details of the user’s web browsing activities between unrelated sites or services), log files (a data file containing information about usage patterns, activities and operations within an application) and/or web beacons (also commonly referred to as web bug, tracking bug, tag, web tag, page tag, tracking pixel, etc.) which allow third parties to collect information about you and your activities on the App and provide you, or enable others to provide you, with functionality within our App, additional personalization or with “behavioral” advertising. We may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or other online services in order to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests, both on the App and on third party applications (including but not limited to search engines and social media applications) as well as through the Sunny website and other electronic communications. Further, third parties who provide us with tracking functionality components may also use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the App in order to provide you with advertising based on your use of the App and to track performance of embedded advertising. As such, third parties may gain the ability to link or aggregate information collected about you when you use the App with other information collected about you elsewhere on the Internet. Third parties may also collect information about your online or application activities over time and across different websites, applications, and other online services and may use this information to provide you with targeted content or advertising. 3.5 Cross-Device Use.The App may permit you to access services, preferences and content across your computing devices from mobile products to tablets. Rather than residing as a static program on your device, key components of the App may be cloud-based and updated periodically to provide you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this experience, we may collect data about you, your device and the way you use our App.  5.1 Information You Provided Directly to Us.You may provide information to us when you use our App, including when you download, register with or log into the App. This information may include, but is not limited to, your PII such as gender, birthday, height, weight, exercise routine data, name, email address, phone number, mailing or billing address, device ID, username and password, registration ID number, financial information, your profile, any medical related information you provide and other information that may identify you. You may also provide NPI such as terms used for searches within the App, responses to questions, workout and exercise routines, schedules, bookmarks, notes, and other information about your activities within and usage of the App. Unless otherwise noted within the App or in this Policy, any information you provide through the App may be processed by, transmitted to, or stored by Sunny and/or its third party providers. Certain information you provide when you use our App and its components may be stored locally on your mobile device. Although we do not transmit information stored locally on your mobile device through use of our App, please be aware that any information stored on your mobile device may leave your mobile device through automatic backup processes, manual download from your mobile device, and through other means outside of our control. In addition, your activities on your mobile device outside of the App may result in such information being transmitted to or otherwise collected by authorized or unauthorized third parties, including through the other apps you access, the websites you visit, and by parties who may gain unauthorized access to your mobile device or data. Any information stored on your mobile device or transmitted over the Internet or any data network could be accessed or intercepted by unauthorized third-parties. As a result, you acknowledge that Sunny cannot assure that the information you submit through the App or stored locally on your mobile device will remain private. Any data you provide or store locally through the App is at your own risk. 5.2 Information We Gather Automatically.If you download, access, or use the App, we may receive and store certain information about you and your mobile device using systematic or automatic data collection technologies, including but not limited to first as well as third party cookies, cookies, log files, web beacons and other similar technical tools. By way of example, this information may include, without limitation:  We may use and process information we collect or receive about you to:  We generally do not share, sell, trade, or rent your PII to others unless you authorize such or if we are required by any legal authority or governmental regulation to do so. We may share NPI or generic aggregated demographic information, not otherwise linked to any PII regarding visitors and users, with our business partners, trusted affiliates, third party service providers and advertisers. Further, we may share your information with our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, as well as entities that provide services to us, including companies that provide payment processing, analytics, data processing and IT services including app development and maintenance and other services. 7.1 Disclosure of Information to Third Party Vendors/Service Providers.We may engage third party vendors and service providers to provide services in connection with the App, outsourced technical support for our programs and services and to facilitate our digital presence. Further, some of the content and services on the App, including advertisements, are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers as well as technology and application providers. We may share PII, NPI or other information (including, without limitation, the number of times an advertisement has been serviced, click information, and geographic limitations) with such third parties as necessary so that they may provide the services for which they have been engaged. 7.2 As Required by Law.We may disclose your information to third parties when required to protect and defend our legal rights, protect the safety and security of our users, prevent fraud, comply with the law or respond to legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity. 7.3 Business Asset Transfer. In the event of sale, transfer, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction. In the event that we sell our business or any assets thereto by way of an acquisition or merger or if we become affiliated with any other individual or entity, personal information may be subject to such transaction and transferred pursuant to that transaction. 7.4 With Your Consent.We may share your information with other third parties when you consent to such sharing.  If you have registered with our App, you may, at any time, access, modify or delete your PII by logging into the App using your username and password and visiting your account profile page. You may also send us an email atadmin@sunnyhealthfitness.comto request correction or deletion of any PII that you have provided to us or request to opt-out of various services. Further, various ancillary services such as email and text applications (message and data rates apply) may allow you to opt-out directly and/or activate “do not track” features. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. If you withdraw a registration or cancel a subscription, we may nonetheless retain your PII in our records and we may continue to use and disclose that data in a manner consistent with this Policy, unless you request deletion of it.  We use a variety of security measures to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards (which vary depending on the sensitivity of the information) designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure or access of PII. However, due to the dynamic nature of transmission and storage of electronic information, no company can guarantee the security of your information. As such, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. By using the App, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use. If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the App or sending an email to you. We do not accept liability resulting from any unintentional disclosure.  Our App is not intended for children under 13 years of age and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed PII to us, please contact us atadmin@sunnyhealthfitness.com. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, we will delete such information from our files. A parent or guardian of a child under age 13 may also review and request deletion of the child’s personal information.  We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy or the App at any time without advance notice. Any revisions to this Policy will be effective upon posting. As such, you should review this Policy periodically to ensure you are aware of any changes. If you object to any changes to this Policy, you must cease using the App. Your continued use of our Apps after any changes or revisions to this Policy indicates your agreement to the terms of the revised Policy.  12.

We encourage you to carefully review this Policy regarding the collection, use and treatment of your information. By using, accessing, or registering with the App, you consent to our collection, use, processing, and disclosure of information in accordance with this Policy.

HOW THIS POLICY APPLIES This Policy applies to information you provide to us or that we collect automatically when you register, visit, access or use the App and when you interact with the App or with App content or applications that may link to or be accessible from or on the App that are provided or managed by a third party. Unless otherwise covered by another primary policy, this Policy also extends to our forums, social media channels, blogs and similar media platforms. However, this Policy does not apply to information we collect when you visit or use any external website or when you communicate with us through email, text or other such ancillary electronic means. For information regarding how we collect and use information when you visit or use Sunny’s website or communicate with us through email, text, or other electronic means, including web-based pages, please refer to our Website privacy policy. This Policy informs you of the following: Who collects your information; The types of information we collect and the related protocols; How we use collected information; How we share and/or disclose your information; Your rights as to the information you provide to us; How we seek to secure your information; How we comply with various associated rules, regulations and laws; and Where you can get answers to your questions about this Policy. 4. COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION When you visit or use our App, we may collect, process or receive information about you as described in this Policy. The App may include links to other websites or platforms, including third party managed pages. For example, the App may provide a link to a web page providing product information or a third party managed web page concerning health and exercise information and resources. If you navigate to such websites, then those external website privacy policies thereby govern the collection of information while you use, view and/or interact on such sites. We may process and use your information for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect or receive the information, or for any lawful basis or otherwise subject to your consent. 4.1 Third Party Providers. The App, its related components or functions may be provided, developed or hosted by third parties that are not necessarily affiliated with Sunny. These entities may receive, collect and/or process information you provide within the App, including information about your use of the App and your activities over time and across third party applications or websites. These third parties may also collect, use, store, process and/or transmit information in accordance with their applicable privacy policies and business practices, which are not under Sunny’s control. For more information on third party practices, please refer to such third parties’ applicable privacy policies, terms of use, end user license agreements, or similar disclosures, available from such third party’s website or by contacting the third party for more information. 4.2 Links to External Websites . The App may include links to external websites not operated or controlled by Sunny. For example, the App may link to a third party website that allows you to submit your information in order to receive health, exercise or lifestyle related content. Please be aware that Sunny does not have control of and is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of such other sites. We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each website that you visit and be careful as to the information you may submit to any such third party. 4.3 Social Media Networks. Sunny maintains a presence on various third party social media sites. However, Sunny does not control and is not responsible for the collection, tracking, use, or disclosure of your information gathered through social media applications or websites or profiles within other applications, or otherwise as a result of your participation in social media platforms. Third party social networking applications and advertisers on such applications, including on the Sunny pages or profiles within those sites, are not obligated to follow or apply this Policy or the Terms of Use. You should directly contact the applicable social media platform provider and refer to their applicable privacy policies if you have any related questions or concerns as to use of those applications. 3.4 Tracking Technologies. The App may use systematic data collection technologies including cookies (a data file saved by a website onto the user’s device that shares details of the user’s web browsing activities between unrelated sites or services), log files (a data file containing information about usage patterns, activities and operations within an application) and/or web beacons (also commonly referred to as web bug, tracking bug, tag, web tag, page tag, tracking pixel, etc.) which allow third parties to collect information about you and your activities on the App and provide you, or enable others to provide you, with functionality within our App, additional personalization or with “behavioral” advertising. We may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or other online services in order to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests, both on the App and on third party applications (including but not limited to search engines and social media applications) as well as through the Sunny website and other electronic communications. Further, third parties who provide us with tracking functionality components may also use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the App in order to provide you with advertising based on your use of the App and to track performance of embedded advertising. As such, third parties may gain the ability to link or aggregate information collected about you when you use the App with other information collected about you elsewhere on the Internet. Third parties may also collect information about your online or application activities over time and across different websites, applications, and other online services and may use this information to provide you with targeted content or advertising. 3.5 Cross-Device Use. The App may permit you to access services, preferences and content across your computing devices from mobile products to tablets. Rather than residing as a static program on your device, key components of the App may be cloud-based and updated periodically to provide you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this experience, we may collect data about you, your device and the way you use our App. 5. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT 5.1 Information You Provided Directly to Us.

Certain information you provide when you use our App and its components may be stored locally on your mobile device. Although we do not transmit information stored locally on your mobile device through use of our App, please be aware that any information stored on your mobile device may leave your mobile device through automatic backup processes, manual download from your mobile device, and through other means outside of our control. In addition, your activities on your mobile device outside of the App may result in such information being transmitted to or otherwise collected by authorized or unauthorized third parties, including through the other apps you access, the websites you visit, and by parties who may gain unauthorized access to your mobile device or data. Any information stored on your mobile device or transmitted over the Internet or any data network could be accessed or intercepted by unauthorized third-parties. As a result, you acknowledge that Sunny cannot assure that the information you submit through the App or stored locally on your mobile device will remain private. Any data you provide or store locally through the App is at your own risk. 5.2 Information We Gather Automatically. If you download, access, or use the App, we may receive and store certain information about you and your mobile device using systematic or automatic data collection technologies, including but not limited to first as well as third party cookies, cookies, log files, web beacons and other similar technical tools.

HOW WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION We generally do not share, sell, trade, or rent your PII to others unless you authorize such or if we are required by any legal authority or governmental regulation to do so. We may share NPI or generic aggregated demographic information, not otherwise linked to any PII regarding visitors and users, with our business partners, trusted affiliates, third party service providers and advertisers. Further, we may share your information with our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, as well as entities that provide services to us, including companies that provide payment processing, analytics, data processing and IT services including app development and maintenance and other services. 7.1 Disclosure of Information to Third Party Vendors/Service Providers. We may engage third party vendors and service providers to provide services in connection with the App, outsourced technical support for our programs and services and to facilitate our digital presence. Further, some of the content and services on the App, including advertisements, are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers as well as technology and application providers. We may share PII, NPI or other information (including, without limitation, the number of times an advertisement has been serviced, click information, and geographic limitations) with such third parties as necessary so that they may provide the services for which they have been engaged. 7.2 As Required by Law. We may disclose your information to third parties when required to protect and defend our legal rights, protect the safety and security of our users, prevent fraud, comply with the law or respond to legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity. 7.3 Business Asset Transfer . In the event of sale, transfer, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction. In the event that we sell our business or any assets thereto by way of an acquisition or merger or if we become affiliated with any other individual or entity, personal information may be subject to such transaction and transferred pursuant to that transaction. 7.4 With Your Consent. We may share your information with other third parties when you consent to such sharing. 8. YOUR RIGHTS If you have registered with our App, you may, at any time, access, modify or delete your PII by logging into the App using your username and password and visiting your account profile page.

Further, various ancillary services such as email and text applications (message and data rates apply) may allow you to opt-out directly and/or activate “do not track” features. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. If you withdraw a registration or cancel a subscription, we may nonetheless retain your PII in our records and we may continue to use and disclose that data in a manner consistent with this Policy, unless you request deletion of it. 9. INFORMATION SECURITY We use a variety of security measures to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards (which vary depending on the sensitivity of the information) designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure or access of PII. However, due to the dynamic nature of transmission and storage of electronic information, no company can guarantee the security of your information. As such, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. By using the App, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use. If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the App or sending an email to you. We do not accept liability resulting from any unintentional disclosure. 10. CHILDREN’S INFORMATION Our App is not intended for children under 13 years of age and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed PII to us, please contact us at admin@sunnyhealthfitness.com . If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, we will delete such information from our files. A parent or guardian of a child under age 13 may also review and request deletion of the child’s personal information. 11. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy or the App at any time without advance notice. Any revisions to this Policy will be effective upon posting. As such, you should review this Policy periodically to ensure you are aware of any changes. If you object to any changes to this Policy, you must cease using the App. Your continued use of our Apps after any changes or revisions to this Policy indicates your agreement to the terms of the revised Policy. 12.
