What is the difference between the Classic Rebounders and the American Tough Rebounder?

The Frame is also produced in a single solid piece, with no welding, making it the most stable frame available yet! This solid frame also makes assembly a thing of the past, just screw on the legs and go. Is the American Tough Rebounder returnable? Due to the weight and size of our American-made trampoline, shipping costs are substantial. As a result, we are unable to accept returns on this product. However, we want you to be fully confident in your purchase. Please reach out to our customer support team before purchasing if you have any questions about the product specifications or compatibility to ensure it's the right fit for you.

The American also boasts superior stability and strength, supporting up to 330 lbs, with no assembly required beyond attaching the legs.
