In-Depth Stability Bar Review What's The Scoop? Why our Stability Bar is Top Notch: Our stabilizer bar attaches to any two legs. It doesn't replace the legs (who wants to keep track of spare legs?!), but slips over existing legs. It's then secured for stability. Our stability bars are adjustable to three different heights! No matter your height or exercise needs there's a height perfect for you. The grips are made of a cushy foam that creates a super tight grip between your hands and the bar. And it fits all our rebounders! Stability Bar handle measures 49 inches, 52 inches, and 55 inches from the floor to the top of the bar. Note: Rebounder is NOT included in this purchase. Additional note: Due to redesigns to our trampolines, the new stabilizer bars are NOT compatible with trampolines purchased prior to around the middle of April 2019. If you purchased one of our trampolines around that time-frame, please check with us, and we will be sure to ship you the correct stabilizer bar for your particular model! As always, we place our customers above all else, and will continue to support legacy models and parts as needed. In-Depth Stability Bar Review What's The Scoop?
