As with all exercise trampolines on the market, bungees can and will break with heavy use over time. And while ours is made from strong latex rubber they too can break.\nCongratulations are in order if this happens though! It means you are getting great trampoline exercise from your rebounder and that’s awesome. Trampoline fitness is a real thing and there are a lot of rebounding exercises out there. Don't worry, we have you covered with a pack of 10 bungees per pack. (12 for Rainbow bungees)\nThese are the same latex rubber bungees shipped with your Leaps and Rebounds rebounder. They fit both sizes of our personal trampolines (40in and 48in).If you're wanting to do your whole Rebounder, we'd recommend purchasing 5 bags for a 48-inch and 4 for a 40-inch Rebounder. For rainbow bungees, you would just need 3 bags for the 40-inch and 4 bags for the 48-inch. \nReplace your stretched and lifeless bungees, available in all colors!",
