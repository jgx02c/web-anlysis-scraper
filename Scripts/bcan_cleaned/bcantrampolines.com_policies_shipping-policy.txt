    Every single one of our customer orders is packed and shipped by our North American distribution center in California and Los Angeles. What this means for you is that each and every product passes through our strict quality control process by real people before getting sent your way. We have partnered with UPS, USPS, FedEx, and Amazon to access the most competitive shipping rates and shipping times across North America. This means free shipping and "prime" shipping times for you. Most orders will be processed and shipped from our warehouses within 2 business days. Once your order has been processed for delivery, you will receive an email with the tracking number associated with your order. The delivery will usually take between 3 to 7 business days to arrive at your destination, once the parcels have left our warehouse. Rural parts of the U.S. can expect their orders within 8 - 10 business days Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an email with tracking information. You can visit the Track Your Order page and get the tracking information by entering your tracking number. We currently only ship within the 48 contiguous United States. Alaska, Hawaii, APO/FPO, US Territories, Canada, or other countries are not available so far. To ensure the safe and efficient delivery of our large, heavy-duty products, we utilize a specialized truck delivery service. This method allows us to provide our customers with a reliable and secure shipping experience. Please be aware that truck delivery may require additional time and coordination compared to standard shipping methods. Our customer service team will be in touch to schedule a delivery date and time that works best for you. Additional fees may apply for truck delivery services. Thank you for your understanding. If our carrier attempts delivery to you but fails several times, they will be forced to return the items to us, in this case, we have now paid for the shipping fee and the return cost, if a customer needs us to re-ship their package, they would be responsible for paying the return cost and the fee to ship the package again for them, if they choose to opt into a cancellation instead, the return cost would then be deducted from their refund subtotal.
