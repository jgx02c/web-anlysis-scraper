    - og:description: ✔ Official Leaps and Rebounds adjustable trampoline handle bar. Please be sure to select the model of rebounder that you have, as it is designed to fit specifically for your model.✔ Provides a strong helping hand, with super grippable and cushy foam handles, to help keep balance for more rewarding exercises.✔ Allows for more creative and challenging exercises on our fast selling mini trampoline.✔ Easy assembly. Attaches to any two trampoline legs. Slip around rebounder legs. Re-attach legs. No spare legs to keep track of like other handle bars.✔ Please note that Leaps and Rebounds beloved 5 STAR rebounder is sold separately.

Our handle bar attaches to any two legs. It doesn't replace the legs (who wants to keep track of spare legs?!), but slips over existing legs. It's then secured for stability. Our handle bars are adjustable to three different heights! No matter your height or exercise needs there's a height perfect for you. The grips are made of a cushy foam that creates a super tight grip between your hands and the bar. And it fits all our rebounders!Stability Bar handle measures 49 inches, 52 inches, and 55 inches from the floor to the top of the bar.
Note: Rebounder is NOT included in this purchase.
Additional note: Due to redesigns to our trampolines, the new stability bars are NOT compatible with trampolines purchased prior to around the middle of April 2019. If you purchased one of our trampolines around that time-frame, please check with us, and we will be sure to ship you the correct handle bar for your particular model! As always, we place our customers above all else, and will continue to support legacy models and parts as needed.
Stay standing on any bounce with our sturdy Stability Bar!
