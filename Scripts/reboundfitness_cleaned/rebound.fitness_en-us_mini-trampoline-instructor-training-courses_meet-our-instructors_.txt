In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again.

JDK Client Natalie says, “Jess always makes exercising fun, full of energy and encouragement. Absolutely love the Bounce classes, they have certainly helped me get through lockdown!” In Person - Cambridgeshire Chiara Cooke Upbeat, feel good, high energy classes with great music! I’m Chiara, I’m 28 and I work full time as a PE and Maths teacher at a secondary school. I have been rebounding since 2017 and attended the classes for 4 years. During lockdown I purchased a rebounder and did online classes around 3 to 4 times a week. I was behind the scenes during lots of Jess’ live classes when we were allowed to exercise in the garden and I just knew I too wanted to teach classes! I was obsessed with rebounding, it’s sooo much fun and a fantastic workout. I love the fact that it is low impact meaning you recover quickly which is perfect alongside going to the gym, my other passion! You can burn so many calories and it really is great for anyone! My classes are upbeat with mostly newer music however we always mix in some older tracks. Our bouncers love cardio, so most tracks are cardio dominated with some conditioning intertwined. We like to add variety and sometimes do a HIIT too! We love to rebound outside when we can in the sunshine! The best part of delivering classes is meeting amazing people, I love that everyone becomes friends through attending my classes, it’s a great mini community! I also love that I help others to feel great and get them to love rebounding too. As a teacher I am always really busy however my classes are my ‘me time’ after work where I can forget about the day and just have a great workout! Online | In Person - Darlington Ian McGee I understand how scary and intimidating starting your fitness journey can be. I promise I can make it that little bit easier. If you want to work out while having fun I’m your guy. A huge passion of mine is helping people achieve their fitness goals. Hi, my name is Ian and I’m an alcoholic. For the longest time those words petrified me. I blocked out all my emotions and the world with drink. I’m the process I nearly destroyed myself and my life. When I first got sober, I was lost, scared, emotional and a million other emotions. However fast forward to today and I’m heading towards my 2 year sobriety. During those 2 years I’ve worked my butt off to fight my way back from my addiction. I’ve transformed my life, body, and mind. I’ve learnt so much along the way about myself and this crazy thing called life. During my recovery I also re-found my passion for fitness, and I want to help others on their journey. I understand first hand how scary and intimidating starting your fitness journey can be. I promise I can make it that little bit easier. If you want to have fun while working on your goals, then I’m you guy. In Person - Cambridgeshire Louise Hyem I am an energitic Rebound Fit Instructor, with a massive passion for trampolining and the health benefits it provides! I want to ensure that everyone who attends my classes has fun whilst gaining a great workout to make them feel amazing! I am a passionate Rebound Fit Instructor and am extremely motivated to bring the “feel good” factor into every class I do! Rebounding classes are so much more than working out, they can provide an array of health benefits alongside being social and providing you with that all important time for yourself! I am passionate about Rebound Fit because since I started classes it has provided all of the above but equally increased my confidence, fitness, network of friends and for the first time ever I look forward to exercising every time I step onto the trampoline! I want others to feel the same and therefore becoming an Instructor was really important to me so I could not only attend but provide the same to those attending my classes! In Person - Cambridgeshire Morgan Howkins-Griffiths These classes are designed for everyone! It’s an opportunity to get moving, have fun and make new friends! These classes are designed for everyone! It’s an opportunity to get moving, have fun and make new friends! I had been attending classes for a year and finally took the leap to become an instructor.

Jude is mad as a hatter, offering high energy bounce classes that can be adapted to suit all abilities. If you provide the smile we will provide the class. .From someone that has been a size 20 putting my foot through a rebounder it still did not put me off. Losing 8 stone and finding bounce as a way of helping to keep the weight off and provide feel good endorphins. Whilst I offer many classes bounce is my passion. There are sprint tracks and steady ones with good music and a general laugh. You will walk away from this class buzzing!!

After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again. JDK Client Natalie says, “Jess always makes exercising fun, full of energy and encouragement. Absolutely love the Bounce classes, they have certainly helped me get through lockdown!” In Person - Cambridgeshire Chiara Cooke Upbeat, feel good, high energy classes with great music! I’m Chiara, I’m 28 and I work full time as a PE and Maths teacher at a secondary school. I have been rebounding since 2017 and attended the classes for 4 years. During lockdown I purchased a rebounder and did online classes around 3 to 4 times a week. I was behind the scenes during lots of Jess’ live classes when we were allowed to exercise in the garden and I just knew I too wanted to teach classes! I was obsessed with rebounding, it’s sooo much fun and a fantastic workout. I love the fact that it is low impact meaning you recover quickly which is perfect alongside going to the gym, my other passion! You can burn so many calories and it really is great for anyone! My classes are upbeat with mostly newer music however we always mix in some older tracks. Our bouncers love cardio, so most tracks are cardio dominated with some conditioning intertwined. We like to add variety and sometimes do a HIIT too! We love to rebound outside when we can in the sunshine! The best part of delivering classes is meeting amazing people, I love that everyone becomes friends through attending my classes, it’s a great mini community! I also love that I help others to feel great and get them to love rebounding too. As a teacher I am always really busy however my classes are my ‘me time’ after work where I can forget about the day and just have a great workout!

After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again. JDK Client Natalie says, “Jess always makes exercising fun, full of energy and encouragement. Absolutely love the Bounce classes, they have certainly helped me get through lockdown!” In Person - Cambridgeshire Chiara Cooke Upbeat, feel good, high energy classes with great music! I’m Chiara, I’m 28 and I work full time as a PE and Maths teacher at a secondary school. I have been rebounding since 2017 and attended the classes for 4 years. During lockdown I purchased a rebounder and did online classes around 3 to 4 times a week. I was behind the scenes during lots of Jess’ live classes when we were allowed to exercise in the garden and I just knew I too wanted to teach classes! I was obsessed with rebounding, it’s sooo much fun and a fantastic workout. I love the fact that it is low impact meaning you recover quickly which is perfect alongside going to the gym, my other passion! You can burn so many calories and it really is great for anyone! My classes are upbeat with mostly newer music however we always mix in some older tracks. Our bouncers love cardio, so most tracks are cardio dominated with some conditioning intertwined. We like to add variety and sometimes do a HIIT too! We love to rebound outside when we can in the sunshine! The best part of delivering classes is meeting amazing people, I love that everyone becomes friends through attending my classes, it’s a great mini community! I also love that I help others to feel great and get them to love rebounding too. As a teacher I am always really busy however my classes are my ‘me time’ after work where I can forget about the day and just have a great workout! Online | In Person - Darlington Ian McGee I understand how scary and intimidating starting your fitness journey can be. I promise I can make it that little bit easier. If you want to work out while having fun I’m your guy. A huge passion of mine is helping people achieve their fitness goals. Hi, my name is Ian and I’m an alcoholic. For the longest time those words petrified me. I blocked out all my emotions and the world with drink. I’m the process I nearly destroyed myself and my life. When I first got sober, I was lost, scared, emotional and a million other emotions. However fast forward to today and I’m heading towards my 2 year sobriety. During those 2 years I’ve worked my butt off to fight my way back from my addiction. I’ve transformed my life, body, and mind. I’ve learnt so much along the way about myself and this crazy thing called life. During my recovery I also re-found my passion for fitness, and I want to help others on their journey. I understand first hand how scary and intimidating starting your fitness journey can be. I promise I can make it that little bit easier.

After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again. JDK Client Natalie says, “Jess always makes exercising fun, full of energy and encouragement. Absolutely love the Bounce classes, they have certainly helped me get through lockdown!” In Person - Cambridgeshire Chiara Cooke Upbeat, feel good, high energy classes with great music! I’m Chiara, I’m 28 and I work full time as a PE and Maths teacher at a secondary school. I have been rebounding since 2017 and attended the classes for 4 years. During lockdown I purchased a rebounder and did online classes around 3 to 4 times a week. I was behind the scenes during lots of Jess’ live classes when we were allowed to exercise in the garden and I just knew I too wanted to teach classes! I was obsessed with rebounding, it’s sooo much fun and a fantastic workout. I love the fact that it is low impact meaning you recover quickly which is perfect alongside going to the gym, my other passion! You can burn so many calories and it really is great for anyone! My classes are upbeat with mostly newer music however we always mix in some older tracks. Our bouncers love cardio, so most tracks are cardio dominated with some conditioning intertwined. We like to add variety and sometimes do a HIIT too! We love to rebound outside when we can in the sunshine! The best part of delivering classes is meeting amazing people, I love that everyone becomes friends through attending my classes, it’s a great mini community! I also love that I help others to feel great and get them to love rebounding too. As a teacher I am always really busy however my classes are my ‘me time’ after work where I can forget about the day and just have a great workout! Online | In Person - Darlington Ian McGee I understand how scary and intimidating starting your fitness journey can be. I promise I can make it that little bit easier. If you want to work out while having fun I’m your guy. A huge passion of mine is helping people achieve their fitness goals. Hi, my name is Ian and I’m an alcoholic. For the longest time those words petrified me. I blocked out all my emotions and the world with drink. I’m the process I nearly destroyed myself and my life. When I first got sober, I was lost, scared, emotional and a million other emotions. However fast forward to today and I’m heading towards my 2 year sobriety. During those 2 years I’ve worked my butt off to fight my way back from my addiction. I’ve transformed my life, body, and mind. I’ve learnt so much along the way about myself and this crazy thing called life. During my recovery I also re-found my passion for fitness, and I want to help others on their journey. I understand first hand how scary and intimidating starting your fitness journey can be. I promise I can make it that little bit easier. If you want to have fun while working on your goals, then I’m you guy. In Person - Cambridgeshire Louise Hyem I am an energitic Rebound Fit Instructor, with a massive passion for trampolining and the health benefits it provides! I want to ensure that everyone who attends my classes has fun whilst gaining a great workout to make them feel amazing! I am a passionate Rebound Fit Instructor and am extremely motivated to bring the “feel good” factor into every class I do! Rebounding classes are so much more than working out, they can provide an array of health benefits alongside being social and providing you with that all important time for yourself! I am passionate about Rebound Fit because since I started classes it has provided all of the above but equally increased my confidence, fitness, network of friends and for the first time ever I look forward to exercising every time I step onto the trampoline! I want others to feel the same and therefore becoming an Instructor was really important to me so I could not only attend but provide the same to those attending my classes! In Person - Cambridgeshire Morgan Howkins-Griffiths These classes are designed for everyone! It’s an opportunity to get moving, have fun and make new friends! These classes are designed for everyone! It’s an opportunity to get moving, have fun and make new friends! I had been attending classes for a year and finally took the leap to become an instructor. I work full time as an engineer but always try to make time for a bounce. It never fails to put a smile on my face.

Jude is mad as a hatter, offering high energy bounce classes that can be adapted to suit all abilities.

Losing 8 stone and finding bounce as a way of helping to keep the weight off and provide feel good endorphins. Whilst I offer many classes bounce is my passion. There are sprint tracks and steady ones with good music and a general laugh. You will walk away from this class buzzing!!

Other high profile clients included Jeffrey Archer, Elizabeth Hurley, Shakira Caine, and Lorraine Kelly. Her programme "Train like a Woman" is internationally recognised and clients from all over the world join her online Zoom classes. The number one factor in any exercise programme should be exercise technique. The Train like a Woman method teaches women how to execute perfect form with each and every exercise which is key to muscle adaptations. The exercises are multi-dimensional, thereby working the larger muscle groups as well as the deep stabilizing muscles, getting to the core of the abs and every other muscle, especially those “mummy bits”. After just a few short sessions you will honestly feel tight, toned, smaller and firmer. We are women, we want to look like women and therefore we should train like women! My Train Like a Woman method is a combination of my favourite,” butt forming, lean legs, and gorgeous abs” exercise routines which I have designed to create fit, firm and beautiful looking bodies. Jenni is passionate about helping others achieve their personal best and rebounding is a firm favourite with her clients!

After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again. JDK Client Natalie says, “Jess always makes exercising fun, full of energy and encouragement. Absolutely love the Bounce classes, they have certainly helped me get through lockdown!” In Person - Cambridgeshire Chiara Cooke Upbeat, feel good, high energy classes with great music! I’m Chiara, I’m 28 and I work full time as a PE and Maths teacher at a secondary school. I have been rebounding since 2017 and attended the classes for 4 years. During lockdown I purchased a rebounder and did online classes around 3 to 4 times a week. I was behind the scenes during lots of Jess’ live classes when we were allowed to exercise in the garden and I just knew I too wanted to teach classes! I was obsessed with rebounding, it’s sooo much fun and a fantastic workout. I love the fact that it is low impact meaning you recover quickly which is perfect alongside going to the gym, my other passion! You can burn so many calories and it really is great for anyone! My classes are upbeat with mostly newer music however we always mix in some older tracks. Our bouncers love cardio, so most tracks are cardio dominated with some conditioning intertwined. We like to add variety and sometimes do a HIIT too! We love to rebound outside when we can in the sunshine! The best part of delivering classes is meeting amazing people, I love that everyone becomes friends through attending my classes, it’s a great mini community! I also love that I help others to feel great and get them to love rebounding too. As a teacher I am always really busy however my classes are my ‘me time’ after work where I can forget about the day and just have a great workout! Online | In Person - Darlington Ian McGee I understand how scary and intimidating starting your fitness journey can be. I promise I can make it that little bit easier. If you want to work out while having fun I’m your guy. A huge passion of mine is helping people achieve their fitness goals. Hi, my name is Ian and I’m an alcoholic. For the longest time those words petrified me. I blocked out all my emotions and the world with drink. I’m the process I nearly destroyed myself and my life. When I first got sober, I was lost, scared, emotional and a million other emotions. However fast forward to today and I’m heading towards my 2 year sobriety. During those 2 years I’ve worked my butt off to fight my way back from my addiction. I’ve transformed my life, body, and mind. I’ve learnt so much along the way about myself and this crazy thing called life. During my recovery I also re-found my passion for fitness, and I want to help others on their journey.

I want others to feel the same and therefore becoming an Instructor was really important to me so I could not only attend but provide the same to those attending my classes!

It’s an opportunity to get moving, have fun and make new friends! I had been attending classes for a year and finally took the leap to become an instructor.

Losing 8 stone and finding bounce as a way of helping to keep the weight off and provide feel good endorphins. Whilst I offer many classes bounce is my passion. There are sprint tracks and steady ones with good music and a general laugh. You will walk away from this class buzzing!!
