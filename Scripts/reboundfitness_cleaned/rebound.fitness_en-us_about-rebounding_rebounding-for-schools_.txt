    Home»Rebounding for schools Rebound Fit is the most inclusive exercise programme for schools and is suitable for all pupils including Children and Young People with SEND needs and also for teachers.Rebounding improves confidence, fitness levels, mental health and concentration levels in children helping achieve the targets for physical activity in pupils and CYP with SEND inclusion.Bouncing is FUN – everyone can do it! Rebound Fit is an awesome, fun exercise programme that will help a school achieve the target of 60 minutes of physical activity for children a day, supporting mental health in children and is an activity that is fully inclusive, allowing children with additional needs, learning difficulties or disabilities to participate alongside everyone else. All children love to bounce and the classes can be incorporated into the PE curriculum, or as before/during/after school clubs and often feature in summer camps once school is out! Rebound Fit offers the best mini trampoline equipment and online & in-person Instructor Training with a Studio foundation course, Childrens workshops, Flexi Bounce for Confidence & Flexi Bounce Therapy (for children and young people with SEND needs) courses and has ongoing Certified Instructor workshops to provide ongoing motivation and inspiration to instructors, We are happy to train Teachers, Young Sports Leaders and there are many freelance Rebound Fit instructors who are happy to come in to teach in school. There are researched benefits from Rebounding. To mention a few;  lymphatic drainage to detoxify the body, its low impact but weight bearing so increases bone density, it burns fat and strengthens all cells in the body more efficiently than other forms of exercise, and its fun which reduces stress, anxiety and depression.Read about all the benefits in our blog. The programme is also suitable for adults so teachers can benefit as well! Our Rebound Fit training is in two parts; first the Studio foundation course which covers all of the Science of rebounding, the importance of the right equipment, and how to execute the core rebounding moves safely and effectively.  With this course the Instructor is certified to teach adults. This is followed by a Childrens Workshop module which enhances the learning to understand how the programme can be adapted for children, the special considerations that need to be made, and how to use the core moves to build exciting workouts for primary/junior school children (which are more games based) and for senior schools children. We understand that Teachers can become “over subscribed” so also offer the training to Young Sports Leaders to enable them to teach a class to their peer groups or younger children providing they have adult supervision.  These are usually those children who are studying PE at GCSE or A Level or who have an active interest in fitness themselves. Increasingly schools are also buying in expertise and there are many freelance fitness instructors who would be keen to be invited in to teach in schools. The same equipment can be used to teach children as well as adults, so there is plenty of scope for hiring the equipment to freelance instructors for use outside school hours.  We know that many schools work alongside leisure centre operators to offer more community based classes. Rebound Therapyis exercise therapy which uses a full-sized trampoline to provide opportunities for movement, therapeutic exercise and recreation for people across virtually the whole spectrum of special needs. We have worked with ReboundTherapy.Org to make this therapy available on our Fit Bounce Pro range of rebounders and have two variations of the training: These programmes can be used stand-alone, or to help adapt the Rebound Fit classes to include all pupils in the same fitness class, helping to meet inclusion targets and build confidence. Flexi Bounce for Confidenceis a comprehensive graded exercise and development programme for the use of an othopaedic quality rebounder by children and adults who are able to bounce independently and includes participants across a wide spectrum of additional needs.

All certified Instructors will join our monthly Instructor Membership which gives access to a wealth of ongoing resources to ensure the ongoing success of your Rebound Fit classes. We offer a flexible “School Instructor Training & Membership” which permits the switch of authorised personnel as people leave/join the school and also special access for cover teachers. Membership includes: As no two schools are the same we offer a custom quotation based on your specific needs. We often find that a School might need a mix of our rebounder models to suit the classes and populations that are likely to use the equipment, for example, SEND students will require our Fit Bounce Pro XL model, SEN and other students will be OK with any of our bungee rebounder models, and the Pro Gym rebounder can also be used providing the children can do a base jump/basic bounce and follow instruction. Please do get in touch to arrange a call-back and we’d be happy to assist you and provide you with our most competitive quote for your school. “We recognise it’s so important to offer today’s generation of young people a range of diverse sports and physical activities that is fun, challenging and captures their interest. Rebounding is yet another exciting form of exercising that appeals to all children of all ages, particularly to those who are not naturally athletic.” “Children are loving it! When I was teaching higher impact activities with them on the hard wood floor they would tire much more quickly. They can exercise for much longer on the Rebounders whilst having great fun. I have noticed a big improvement in the Children’s balance, coordination and the heavier girls have all lost weight, so they are very happy. What a great alternative workout especially for those who are not really into mainstream sport!”” “The classes went really well. The girls thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The Instructor pitched it at exactly the right level and incorporated balance, strength, and co-ordination work alongside cardio-vascular exercise. A total workout! The rebounders are now going onto Chilworth School to be used there after Easter.” “I can unreservedly recommend Rebound Fit classes for your school. Our children can’t wait for them to return this autumn to start Rebounding again. It is appropriate for all year groups and fitness levels and the children get really excited when they see the hall laid out ready and are super motivated to participate. Rebound Fit ticks all of our PE/Sport Premium boxes: not only does it improve fitness and encourage participation, the smiles and laughter tell me it’s good for mental health as well” “All of the children had a positive attitude towards the Rebound Fit classes and could see the benefits from the rebound workouts. They all found the classes more fun than traditional circuit training. Staff have observed a significant increase in stamina and over all fitness in most of the Children which has shown in their recent match form, resulting in the ability to finish games a lot stronger with energy to spare and in just 12 weeks balance improved by 200% - 400% !” Customer Serviceservice@rebound.fitnessTel:+44 (0) 333 444 0846Tel:001 (262) 217 0846 Media Enquiries:service@rebound.fitness   Website byWe Are Flamingo|Privacy Policy|Terms & Conditions © 2025 Rebound Fitness.

Home » Rebounding for schools Interested in launching Rebound Fit in your school? Rebound Fit is the most inclusive exercise programme for schools and is suitable for all pupils including Children and Young People with SEND needs and also for teachers. Rebounding improves confidence, fitness levels, mental health and concentration levels in children helping achieve the targets for physical activity in pupils and CYP with SEND inclusion. Bouncing is FUN – everyone can do it! Why Launch REBOUND FIT? Rebound Fit is an awesome, fun exercise programme that will help a school achieve the target of 60 minutes of physical activity for children a day, supporting mental health in children and is an activity that is fully inclusive, allowing children with additional needs, learning difficulties or disabilities to participate alongside everyone else. All children love to bounce and the classes can be incorporated into the PE curriculum, or as before/during/after school clubs and often feature in summer camps once school is out! Rebound Fit offers the best mini trampoline equipment and online & in-person Instructor Training with a Studio foundation course, Childrens workshops, Flexi Bounce for Confidence & Flexi Bounce Therapy (for children and young people with SEND needs) courses and has ongoing Certified Instructor workshops to provide ongoing motivation and inspiration to instructors, We are happy to train Teachers, Young Sports Leaders and there are many freelance Rebound Fit instructors who are happy to come in to teach in school. There are researched benefits from Rebounding. To mention a few;  lymphatic drainage to detoxify the body, its low impact but weight bearing so increases bone density, it burns fat and strengthens all cells in the body more efficiently than other forms of exercise, and its fun which reduces stress, anxiety and depression. Read about all the benefits in our blog. The programme is also suitable for adults so teachers can benefit as well! Contact Us Rebound Fit for Children & Teachers Flexi Bounce for Confidence Flexi Bounce Therapy Ongoing Support Equipment and Packages Rebound Fit for Children and Teachers Our Rebound Fit training is in two parts; first the Studio foundation course which covers all of the Science of rebounding, the importance of the right equipment, and how to execute the core rebounding moves safely and effectively.  With this course the Instructor is certified to teach adults. This is followed by a Childrens Workshop module which enhances the learning to understand how the programme can be adapted for children, the special considerations that need to be made, and how to use the core moves to build exciting workouts for primary/junior school children (which are more games based) and for senior schools children. We understand that Teachers can become “over subscribed” so also offer the training to Young Sports Leaders to enable them to teach a class to their peer groups or younger children providing they have adult supervision.  These are usually those children who are studying PE at GCSE or A Level or who have an active interest in fitness themselves. Increasingly schools are also buying in expertise and there are many freelance fitness instructors who would be keen to be invited in to teach in schools. The same equipment can be used to teach children as well as adults, so there is plenty of scope for hiring the equipment to freelance instructors for use outside school hours.  We know that many schools work alongside leisure centre operators to offer more community based classes. Contact Us Flexi Bounce for Confidence Rebound Therapy is exercise therapy which uses a full-sized trampoline to provide opportunities for movement, therapeutic exercise and recreation for people across virtually the whole spectrum of special needs. We have worked with ReboundTherapy.Org to make this therapy available on our Fit Bounce Pro range of rebounders and have two variations of the training: Flexi Bounce for Confidence which is aimed at all pupils, including children and young people with SEND needs who are more independent.  and Flexi Bounce Therapy which is aimed at children and young people with SEND needs who require more physical support to participate. These programmes can be used stand-alone, or to help adapt the Rebound Fit classes to include all pupils in the same fitness class, helping to meet inclusion targets and build confidence. Flexi Bounce for Confidence is a comprehensive graded exercise and development programme for the use of an othopaedic quality rebounder by children and adults who are able to bounce independently and includes participants across a wide spectrum of additional needs. It comprises 6 steps: Study of reading material, Study of Flexi-Bounce Therapy exercises for ambulant students, together with student record sheets, Study of Brain Stimulation exercises and accompanying worksheet, Individual exercise video clips for recapping and cross referencing with worksheet, Short theory assessment paper based on reading material in Step 1 and general workplace situations, Practical assessment by video.

Ask for Call Back What Schools have to say about Rebound Fit ... “ We recognise it’s so important to offer today’s generation of young people a range of diverse sports and physical activities that is fun, challenging and captures their interest. Rebounding is yet another exciting form of exercising that appeals to all children of all ages, particularly to those who are not naturally athletic. ” Cllr Andy Connelly Leicester City Council “ Children are loving it! When I was teaching higher impact activities with them on the hard wood floor they would tire much more quickly. They can exercise for much longer on the Rebounders whilst having great fun. I have noticed a big improvement in the Children’s balance, coordination and the heavier girls have all lost weight, so they are very happy. What a great alternative workout especially for those who are not really into mainstream sport!” ” Hannah Lewis, Rebound Fit Instructor Rodborough School “ The classes went really well. The girls thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The Instructor pitched it at exactly the right level and incorporated balance, strength, and co-ordination work alongside cardio-vascular exercise. A total workout! The rebounders are now going onto Chilworth School to be used there after Easter. ” Sue Jobling Head of PE, Gosford House School “ I can unreservedly recommend Rebound Fit classes for your school. Our children can’t wait for them to return this autumn to start Rebounding again. It is appropriate for all year groups and fitness levels and the children get really excited when they see the hall laid out ready and are super motivated to participate.

Ask for Call Back What Schools have to say about Rebound Fit ... “ We recognise it’s so important to offer today’s generation of young people a range of diverse sports and physical activities that is fun, challenging and captures their interest. Rebounding is yet another exciting form of exercising that appeals to all children of all ages, particularly to those who are not naturally athletic. ” Cllr Andy Connelly Leicester City Council “ Children are loving it! When I was teaching higher impact activities with them on the hard wood floor they would tire much more quickly. They can exercise for much longer on the Rebounders whilst having great fun. I have noticed a big improvement in the Children’s balance, coordination and the heavier girls have all lost weight, so they are very happy. What a great alternative workout especially for those who are not really into mainstream sport!” ” Hannah Lewis, Rebound Fit Instructor Rodborough School “ The classes went really well. The girls thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The Instructor pitched it at exactly the right level and incorporated balance, strength, and co-ordination work alongside cardio-vascular exercise. A total workout! The rebounders are now going onto Chilworth School to be used there after Easter. ” Sue Jobling Head of PE, Gosford House School “ I can unreservedly recommend Rebound Fit classes for your school. Our children can’t wait for them to return this autumn to start Rebounding again. It is appropriate for all year groups and fitness levels and the children get really excited when they see the hall laid out ready and are super motivated to participate. Rebound Fit ticks all of our PE/Sport Premium boxes: not only does it improve fitness and encourage participation, the smiles and laughter tell me it’s good for mental health as well ” Kay Corley Headteacher, William De Yaxley Church of England Academy “ All of the children had a positive attitude towards the Rebound Fit classes and could see the benefits from the rebound workouts. They all found the classes more fun than traditional circuit training. Staff have observed a significant increase in stamina and over all fitness in most of the Children which has shown in their recent match form, resulting in the ability to finish games a lot stronger with energy to spare and in just 12 weeks balance improved by 200% - 400% ! ” Andy Barclay Elite Junior Tennis Coach Interested in launching Rebound Fit in your school?

Ask for Call Back What Schools have to say about Rebound Fit ... “ We recognise it’s so important to offer today’s generation of young people a range of diverse sports and physical activities that is fun, challenging and captures their interest. Rebounding is yet another exciting form of exercising that appeals to all children of all ages, particularly to those who are not naturally athletic. ” Cllr Andy Connelly Leicester City Council “ Children are loving it! When I was teaching higher impact activities with them on the hard wood floor they would tire much more quickly. They can exercise for much longer on the Rebounders whilst having great fun. I have noticed a big improvement in the Children’s balance, coordination and the heavier girls have all lost weight, so they are very happy. What a great alternative workout especially for those who are not really into mainstream sport!” ” Hannah Lewis, Rebound Fit Instructor Rodborough School “ The classes went really well. The girls thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The Instructor pitched it at exactly the right level and incorporated balance, strength, and co-ordination work alongside cardio-vascular exercise. A total workout! The rebounders are now going onto Chilworth School to be used there after Easter. ” Sue Jobling Head of PE, Gosford House School “ I can unreservedly recommend Rebound Fit classes for your school. Our children can’t wait for them to return this autumn to start Rebounding again. It is appropriate for all year groups and fitness levels and the children get really excited when they see the hall laid out ready and are super motivated to participate. Rebound Fit ticks all of our PE/Sport Premium boxes: not only does it improve fitness and encourage participation, the smiles and laughter tell me it’s good for mental health as well ” Kay Corley Headteacher, William De Yaxley Church of England Academy “ All of the children had a positive attitude towards the Rebound Fit classes and could see the benefits from the rebound workouts. They all found the classes more fun than traditional circuit training. Staff have observed a significant increase in stamina and over all fitness in most of the Children which has shown in their recent match form, resulting in the ability to finish games a lot stronger with energy to spare and in just 12 weeks balance improved by 200% - 400% ! ” Andy Barclay Elite Junior Tennis Coach    What Schools have to say about Rebound Fit ... “ We recognise it’s so important to offer today’s generation of young people a range of diverse sports and physical activities that is fun, challenging and captures their interest.
