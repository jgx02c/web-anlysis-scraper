 <h3>Account Information</h3>
 <div>
  <div>
   If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
  </div>
  <ul>
   <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <div>
   Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
  </div>
  <div>
   Opting out of email marketing:&nbsp;You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:
  </div>
  <ul>
   <li>Access your account settings and update your preferences.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
  <div>
   Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.&nbsp;

   <h4>Verification process</h4>
   <div>
    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system.

For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
   </div>
   <div>
    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
   </div>

   <ul>
    <li>you may object to the processing of your personal data</li>

    <li>you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li>you may request to opt-out from the use of your personal information for third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the date of the request submission.</li>
   </ul>
