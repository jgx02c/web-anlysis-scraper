Assembly time varies from person to person, however it seems to average out to a 15 minute process from start to finish. Can I assemble it myself with no help? For most people assembly will be a 1 person job. It's a fairly simple process and doesn't require multiple hands to put together. What Tools are included for Assembly? We include the only tool you should need for assembly, our bungee tool to make looping the bungees onto the frame quick and simple. Everything Else can be assembled with just your hands with ease! Does the American Edition Trampoline come Assembled? Yes! Our Limited American Edition Trampoline comes pre-assembled and all you have to do is screw on the legs and start bouncing! Product Specifications Are all Rebounders the same height? Yes, all of our Rebounder sizes stand 13 inches off the ground and all legs are 12 inches tall. Do you sell a stabilizer bar? Yes, we do! You can find it by clicking here! What size rebounder does the stabilizer bar fit? We have stabilizer bars that fit both the 40 inch and 48 inch rebounders. They are size specific. If you have a 40-inch rebounder, you need the bar built for that size rebounder. Same for the 48-inch. How tall is your stabilizer bar? The stability bar has 3 height settings. They are identical for both sized rebounders. 1st notch = 48 inches from the ground to handle 2nd notch = 51 inches from the ground to handle 3rd notch = 54 inches from the ground to handle I ordered a different Rebounder from somewhere else. Will the Stability Bar work for my Rebounder? Unfortunately, it will not. Our Stability Bars are specifically designed to only fit our Mini Trampoline and the Stability bar screws into the Frame of the Rebounder. What is the weight limit of your rebounder? Our 40-inch rebounder has a weight limit of 250 pounds and our 48-inch rebounder has a weight limit of 270 pounds. The weight limit is measured by the bungees. Not the strength of the frame or jump mat. What is the jump surface diameter of your rebounder? The 40-inch Jump Surface Diameter is 25.5 inches, 29 inches including the color strip. The 48-inch Jump Surface Diameter is 36.5 inches, 40 inches including the color strip. What is the full mat size? The 40 Full Mat Size including the bungee cover is 39 Inches and the 48 Full Mat Size is 47.5 inches What is the height of our rebounder trampoline? The 40-inch and 48-inch rebounder are both 13 inches from the ground. How many bungees come with our rebounder? The 40-inch rebounder comes with 36 bungees - 2 packs of 18. 32 bungees complete the assembly. The 48-inch rebounder comes with 42 bungees - 2 packs of 21. 40 bungees complete the assembly. How many bungees come with a pack of bungees on your Bungee Page? Our Bungees come with 10 bungees to a pack and 12 Bungees for our Rainbow Packs. My bungees are too hard! Do they get softer? Yes, our bungees do soften over time. However, we do offer calibration bungees to soften your bounce more if desired. How much head clearance do I need to rebound? No more than two feet taller than you are is required. Most exercise movements won't bounce you more than 2 - 3 inches above the mat. Lifestyle Is Rebounding for me? Yes! If you want an exercise that gives yourself better health and a higher level of fitness AND you are under the weight limit of our rebounder, then our rebounder is definitely for you. You could be an elder who wants to stay flexible, a busy stay-at-home mom, an athlete who needs to warm up, or a college student who wants a fun exercise. Rebounding is such a fundamental exercise that everyone has something to gain. Rebounding is right up there with swimming and jogging. You can't go wrong. Here at Leaps & Rebounds, we believe fitness should never be limited by age, circumstance or where you work out. It should be accessible to everyone who wants to get fit and healthy. How can I justify the cost? We price our rebounders very conservatively compared to our competitors. At $190 and $200, we understand our rebounder is an investment, but also a great value. You can justify the cost based on value. Comparatively speaking our rebounder is much cheaper than a high priced competitor, motorized treadmill, road bike, or a gym membership. For nearly a quarter of the price you can have a rebounder in your home that provides better benefits, doesn't take up too much space, is available to you 24/7 and is a lot more fun. You can also justify the cost based on benefits. Honestly, good health and wellness are hard to put a price on. Being healthy and fit gives you a better quality of life. You have more energy, are happier and have a better personal image of yourself. If you have those things, you are doing better than most people! What am I really losing by not rebounding? Plenty, right? You have dreams and aspirations for yourself. You daydream and imagine yourself being more active and fit, which makes you feel and move a little younger. You imagine a life with consistent exercise is more organized and successful, while being less stressful. You imagine a 30-minute jump on the rebounder during our hectic day giving you a moment of sanity where you recapture a little part of yourself. You lose the chance to make those daydreams a reality. That's a shame. How do I know which size works for me? Both sizes are great! It just depends on how much room you have and how much of a bounce you want. If you are limited on space, the 40-inch is great and it is a slightly firmer bounce than the 48 since the bungees are stretched less. The 48-inch is great if you'd like extra jumping space and more of a slightly softer bounce. Our most popular size is the 48-inch and a lot of our Team prefers that size as when you jump on the 40-inch it's easy to step on the bungee cover part instead of the middle of the mat. Payment How can I pay? You can pay using: Visa, Discover, Mastercard, and American Express Paypal, Amazon Pay, Shop Pay, Apple Pay, Google Pay And also, JCB, Diners Club Do you offer Financing?
