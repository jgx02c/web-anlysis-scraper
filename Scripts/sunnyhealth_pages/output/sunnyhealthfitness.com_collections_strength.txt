You can strengthen your lower body leg muscles and increase muscle mass - helping to improve your mobility in the hips and ankles by enabling motion in a safe and effective way. Power squats will improve your ability to jump further distances with more power. Squats will also strengthen your back and glutes, but always make sure to stretch properly before any exercise or workout session. If you are looking to get a full-body workout, you have to include our strength training attachments in your training routine.

We have doorway chin up bars that are sturdy, chrome plated steel bars, with a max weight capacity of 220 lb. You can achieve maximum stability and grip with our premium non-slip, soft padded hand grips. Getting ready to start doing push ups? We offer Push-Up Bars designed to specifically target your muscles while avoiding doing damage to your joints & wrists. You can go deeper with each successive push-up with our push-up handles, aiding you to achieve a more efficient workout and push for few extra reps every time.
