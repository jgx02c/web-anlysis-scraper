Errol is a committed, creative and self-motivated Sport & Physical Activity Development Specialist, with extensive experience in development within the public, volunteer and private sector. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me.  Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again. Chloe & Francesca are fitness presenters, influencers and group exercise experts and winners of Fitness Influencer of the year at FitPro 2021. They choreograph high, energy, exciting music and have presented at fitness events across the UK including Fitness Fiesta, Colour Run, Colour Rush as well as appearing on TV, most recently Sunday Brunch.  ✨ FITNESS Presenters/Dancers✨ ONLINE & LIVE WORKOUTS✨ Life Coach Training✨ @sure UK & @kryjer_world & @reboundfithq✨ @fitproawardsuk 2020/21 – Winners of “Fitness Influencer of the Year” Client Becky Blay says, “My favourite trainers in the world!

The Rebound Fit class is the most fun class to do, I can’t wait to do it again! xx”High intensity, low impact workouts suitable for all fitness levels. Sweat and Sparkle with us Twins! xxx Shirley an international training course tutor and consultant for Rebound Therapy.She competed in trampolining from the age of 11 and was chosen for the England squad when she was just 16. When Shirley retired from competitive trampolining she became a trampoline coach and together with Paul set up the Saturn V Gym Club in 1993 together with a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy.  Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul and Shirley’s passion. In 2006, Shirley and Paul joined forces with Eddy Anderson (the founder of Rebound Therapy) and took on the responsibility of building the Rebound Therapy website (ReboundTherapy.org), formalising the development programme, and expanding the Rebound Therapy training course programme internationally. As Rebound Therapy developed, Shirley and Paul gave away their mainstream gymnastic and trampoline clubs to their most loyal coaches; all of whom had started with them as children and developed into coaches as they grew older. Paul and Shirley’s plans for the future are to continue to grow Rebound Therapy worldwide so that as many people as possible with disabilities have access to the enormous benefits that Rebound Therapy can offer. Rebound Therapy is well established in the UK, and Paul has so far worked with governing bodies and eminent organisations to set up practitioner training centres in Australia, Canada, USA and South Africa.Paul and Shirley have four children between them. Their daughter Lois manages the Saturn V Rebound Hall and works as the Resources Director and online training course assessor for ReboundTherapy.org Of their three sons; the eldest, Neil, is a builder, the next one, Gavin is a film maker, and their youngest, Jamie has followed in the footsteps of Paul’s early career and is a professional entertainer having worked in musical theatre since the age of 11, including five years in London’s West End, a world tour, and he has also starred in a major Netflix series; The Alienist. James is co-founder of Rebound Fitness and with over 25 years in the industry ensures we have the best Fitness Presenters to create exciting and motivating workouts and designs our high quality mini-trampolines. A regular contributor to national publications like Mens Fitness, Health & Fitness magazine and appearances on ITV’s Loose Women he works with a varied client base specializing in corrective exercise and high performance conditioning for athletes and fitness professionals.  James specialised in assessing individual needs to ensure all round fitness and wellbeing, devising programs encompassing diet and nutrition, physical exercise, relaxation and time management. With a vast and varied client base he supported athletes and fitness professionals in corrective exercise, injury rehabilitation and high performance conditioning to help them achieve they goals. He also ran a team of Personal Trainers at the Royal Berkshire club and as graduate of the CHEK institute had firm beliefs about the benefits of functional training but also supporting clients in a more holistic way to help them achieve their goals. So very much a 1:1 training approach. Group exercise classes were often aimed at the more experienced individuals and in a class of 30 it is almost impossible to provide the right coaching and support on technique and to structure a class to suit all abilities so many clients were giving up after just a few sessions or picking up injuries. James was always researching new ideas, techniques, equipment to introduce to his clients and was one of the early adopters of the stability ball developing many programmes built around this equipment and use of own body weight. It was during one of these research phases that James came across the science of rebounding – and he was blown away by not only the many scientifically proven benefits of bouncing on a high quality mini-trampoline, but also that it was low impact, was weight bearing, and it was possible to devise workout routines in a group setting that were truly inclusive. Everyone could do a rebounding class, regardless of age, gender or fitness level. Best of all it was such a FUN class most people did not even think of it as exercise! To shorten the story, James teamed up with one of his clients who was in the “I don’t like exercise” camp and after a short period working with a rebounder they teamed up to form the Rebound Fitness business. The rest is history. Rebound Fitness now sells it’s own high quality rebounders and accessories internationally and has a world class training programme for Instructors endorsed by CIMSPA and a massive library of workouts that are available Online Live and On Demand to customers. James continues to innovate and we have expanded our programme into Schools, to support adults & children with a wide range of additional needs through our flexi bounce programme in partnership with ReboundTherapy.org, and are embarking on taking rebound fitness into retirement and care homes. Watch this space …….. Jenni is an international fitness and nutrition consultant. Author, fitness journalist, and creator of four DVDs. Through her passion, she was once voted Britain’s top fitness trainer by the ‘Best of British’ publications. The highlight of her career was having the honour of working for Princess Diana for seven years.  Her programme "Train like a Woman" is internationally recognised and clients from all over the world join her online Zoom classes. The Train like a Woman method teaches women how to execute perfect form with each and every exercise which is key to muscle adaptations. The exercises are multi-dimensional, thereby working the larger muscle groups as well as the deep stabilizing muscles, getting to the core of the abs and every other muscle, especially those “mummy bits”. After just a few short sessions you will honestly feel tight, toned, smaller and firmer. Jenni is passionate about helping others achieve their personal best and rebounding is a firm favourite with her clients! Heather is co-founder of Rebound Fitness and with over 40 years working in the IT industry found herself being “guinea pig” to this new thing called Rebounding. A committed office bound, “I don’t like exercise” person who was always complaining of not having time to train found herself hooked on this time efficient, effective workout and as her overall health and fitness levels improved became a firm convert and advocate for Rebounding to health.  Heather and James teamed up to develop the Rebound Fitness business combining skills and expertise in the design of high quality, safe & cost effective equipment with creative & innovate exercise programmes to engage consumer interest, with sales & marketing and back office business skills to build the business we have today. With both of us working alongside the “day job” the first few years targeted the UK gym market with launches in flagship clubs for Esporta, Virgin Active, DC Leisure to name a few. Then came the schools launch in 2007 with the Governments “Every Child Matters” initiative and funding leading up to the 2012 Olympics. Soon recognizing that only around 15% of the population hold a Gym membership we turned our attention to developing DVD workouts and home rebounder equipment and launching this on Amazon triggered our international expansion. Now working full-time in the Rebound Fitness business Heather is passionate about Rebounding and ensuring that the people who can benefit the most from rebounding are aware of the benefits and can access the equipment and workouts they need. With James she continues to reach for new markets either directly, or through partnerships such as with ReboundTherapy.org and JDK Fitness.She also finds the time to do “Nana duties” as you will see from the photo of her getting in her workout with the support of her Grandson Jude!

In 1993 he set up the UK’s first full time Rebound Therapy centre. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul’s passion and now teamed with Rebound Fitness can offer this fantastic therapy on mini-trampolines in their own homes! Paul is the CEO of Rebound Therapy International Ltd (operates under the name ReboundTherapy.org), an international training course tutor, conference speaker and consultant. Paul is the son of professional entertainers and started work at the age of 3 as an actor in TV commercials. At the age of 11 he found two new loves: gymnastics and music. In 1977 at the age of 18 he took his first gymnastic coaching course which was quickly followed by trampoline coaching and more advanced coaching courses. At the same age he started making his living as a gymnastic and trampoline coach and as a professional drummer and singer. He spent the next 15 years as a freelance mainstream and disabilities coach for schools and clubs, and as an entertainer. In 1992, Paul met Shirley Minter (now Shirley Kaye). Shirley was an international trampoline performer and experienced coach. The same year, Paul and Shirley set up a gymnastic and trampoline club, calling it the Saturn V Gym Club. This grew rapidly and by the year 2000 they had 9 branches with over 2500 members. One of the branches, which they set up in 1993 is a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. It is based in Caterham, Surrey, and is called the Saturn V Rebound Hall. The centre grew rapidly and within a year became the first full time centre of its kind in the UK. To this day it is still the model used by others who set up specialist disability centres. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul and Shirley’s passion. In 2006, he and Shirley joined forces with Eddy Anderson (the founder of Rebound Therapy) and took on the responsibility of building the Rebound Therapy website (ReboundTherapy.org), formalising the development programme, and expanding the Rebound Therapy training course programme internationally.

James was always researching new ideas, techniques, equipment to introduce to his clients and was one of the early adopters of the stability ball developing many programmes built around this equipment and use of own body weight. It was during one of these research phases that James came across the science of rebounding – and he was blown away by not only the many scientifically proven benefits of bouncing on a high quality mini-trampoline, but also that it was low impact, was weight bearing, and it was possible to devise workout routines in a group setting that were truly inclusive. Everyone could do a rebounding class, regardless of age, gender or fitness level. Best of all it was such a FUN class most people did not even think of it as exercise! To shorten the story, James teamed up with one of his clients who was in the “I don’t like exercise” camp and after a short period working with a rebounder they teamed up to form the Rebound Fitness business. The rest is history. Rebound Fitness now sells it’s own high quality rebounders and accessories internationally and has a world class training programme for Instructors endorsed by CIMSPA and a massive library of workouts that are available Online Live and On Demand to customers. James continues to innovate and we have expanded our programme into Schools, to support adults & children with a wide range of additional needs through our flexi bounce programme in partnership with ReboundTherapy.org, and are embarking on taking rebound fitness into retirement and care homes.

The highlight of her career was having the honour of working for Princess Diana for seven years. Other high profile clients included Jeffrey Archer, Elizabeth Hurley, Shakira Caine, and Lorraine Kelly. Her programme "Train like a Woman" is internationally recognised and clients from all over the world join her online Zoom classes. The Train like a Woman method teaches women how to execute perfect form with each and every exercise which is key to muscle adaptations. The exercises are multi-dimensional, thereby working the larger muscle groups as well as the deep stabilizing muscles, getting to the core of the abs and every other muscle, especially those “mummy bits”. After just a few short sessions you will honestly feel tight, toned, smaller and firmer. Jenni is passionate about helping others achieve their personal best and rebounding is a firm favourite with her clients! Co-Founder & Director Heather Moore Heather is co-founder of Rebound Fitness and with over 40 years working in the IT industry found herself being “guinea pig” to this new thing called Rebounding.

A committed office bound, “I don’t like exercise” person who was always complaining of not having time to train found herself hooked on this time efficient, effective workout and as her overall health and fitness levels improved became a firm convert and advocate for Rebounding to health. Heather and James teamed up to develop the Rebound Fitness business combining skills and expertise in the design of high quality, safe & cost effective equipment with creative & innovate exercise programmes to engage consumer interest, with sales & marketing and back office business skills to build the business we have today. With both of us working alongside the “day job” the first few years targeted the UK gym market with launches in flagship clubs for Esporta, Virgin Active, DC Leisure to name a few. Then came the schools launch in 2007 with the Governments “Every Child Matters” initiative and funding leading up to the 2012 Olympics. Soon recognizing that only around 15% of the population hold a Gym membership we turned our attention to developing DVD workouts and home rebounder equipment and launching this on Amazon triggered our international expansion. Now working full-time in the Rebound Fitness business Heather is passionate about Rebounding and ensuring that the people who can benefit the most from rebounding are aware of the benefits and can access the equipment and workouts they need. With James she continues to reach for new markets either directly, or through partnerships such as with ReboundTherapy.org and JDK Fitness. She also finds the time to do “Nana duties” as you will see from the photo of her getting in her workout with the support of her Grandson Jude!

In 1993 he set up the UK’s first full time Rebound Therapy centre. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul’s passion and now teamed with Rebound Fitness can offer this fantastic therapy on mini-trampolines in their own homes! Paul is the CEO of Rebound Therapy International Ltd (operates under the name ReboundTherapy.org), an international training course tutor, conference speaker and consultant. Paul is the son of professional entertainers and started work at the age of 3 as an actor in TV commercials. At the age of 11 he found two new loves: gymnastics and music. In 1977 at the age of 18 he took his first gymnastic coaching course which was quickly followed by trampoline coaching and more advanced coaching courses. At the same age he started making his living as a gymnastic and trampoline coach and as a professional drummer and singer. He spent the next 15 years as a freelance mainstream and disabilities coach for schools and clubs, and as an entertainer. In 1992, Paul met Shirley Minter (now Shirley Kaye). Shirley was an international trampoline performer and experienced coach. The same year, Paul and Shirley set up a gymnastic and trampoline club, calling it the Saturn V Gym Club. This grew rapidly and by the year 2000 they had 9 branches with over 2500 members. One of the branches, which they set up in 1993 is a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. It is based in Caterham, Surrey, and is called the Saturn V Rebound Hall. The centre grew rapidly and within a year became the first full time centre of its kind in the UK. To this day it is still the model used by others who set up specialist disability centres. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul and Shirley’s passion. In 2006, he and Shirley joined forces with Eddy Anderson (the founder of Rebound Therapy) and took on the responsibility of building the Rebound Therapy website (ReboundTherapy.org), formalising the development programme, and expanding the Rebound Therapy training course programme internationally. As Rebound Therapy developed, Paul and Shirley gave away their mainstream gymnastic and trampoline clubs to their most loyal coaches; all of whom had started with them as children and developed into coaches as they grew older. Paul now spends all his time working in Rebound Therapy. He and Shirley head a team of 11, comprising 9 training course tutors and 2 office staff.

Rebound Master Trainer Jess Lockhart I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again.

Rebound Master Trainer Jess Lockhart I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again.

She competed in trampolining from the age of 11 and was chosen for the England squad when she was just 16. When Shirley retired from competitive trampolining she became a trampoline coach and together with Paul set up the Saturn V Gym Club in 1993 together with a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. Shirley is an international training course tutor and consultant for Rebound Therapy, and their Finance Director. She competed in trampolining from the age of 11 and was chosen for the England squad when she was just 16. When Shirley retired from competitive trampolining she became a trampoline coach and together with Paul set up the Saturn V Gym Club in 1993 together with a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. The Saturn V Rebound Hall based in Caterham, Surrey, became the first full time centre of its kind in the UK. To this day it is still the model used by others who set up specialist disability centres. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul and Shirley’s passion. In 2006, Shirley and Paul joined forces with Eddy Anderson (the founder of Rebound Therapy) and took on the responsibility of building the Rebound Therapy website (ReboundTherapy.org), formalising the development programme, and expanding the Rebound Therapy training course programme internationally. As Rebound Therapy developed, Shirley and Paul gave away their mainstream gymnastic and trampoline clubs to their most loyal coaches; all of whom had started with them as children and developed into coaches as they grew older. Paul and Shirley’s plans for the future are to continue to grow Rebound Therapy worldwide so that as many people as possible with disabilities have access to the enormous benefits that Rebound Therapy can offer. Rebound Therapy is well established in the UK, and Paul has so far worked with governing bodies and eminent organisations to set up practitioner training centres in Australia, Canada, USA and South Africa. Paul and Shirley have four children between them. Their daughter Lois manages the Saturn V Rebound Hall and works as the Resources Director and online training course assessor for ReboundTherapy.org Of their three sons; the eldest, Neil, is a builder, the next one, Gavin is a film maker, and their youngest, Jamie has followed in the footsteps of Paul’s early career and is a professional entertainer having worked in musical theatre since the age of 11, including five years in London’s West End, a world tour, and he has also starred in a major Netflix series; The Alienist. Co-Founder and Director James Winfield James is co-founder of Rebound Fitness and with over 25 years in the industry ensures we have the best Fitness Presenters to create exciting and motivating workouts and designs our high quality mini-trampolines. A regular contributor to national publications like Mens Fitness, Health & Fitness magazine and appearances on ITV’s Loose Women he works with a varied client base specializing in corrective exercise and high performance conditioning for athletes and fitness professionals. James is co-founder of Rebound Fitness and with over 25 years in the industry ensures we have the best Fitness Presenters to create exciting and motivating workouts and designs our high quality mini-trampolines. A regular contributor to national publications like Mens Fitness, Health & Fitness magazine and appearances on ITV’s Loose Women he works with a varied client base specializing in corrective exercise and high performance conditioning for athletes and fitness professionals. James specialised in assessing individual needs to ensure all round fitness and wellbeing, devising programs encompassing diet and nutrition, physical exercise, relaxation and time management. With a vast and varied client base he supported athletes and fitness professionals in corrective exercise, injury rehabilitation and high performance conditioning to help them achieve they goals. He also ran a team of Personal Trainers at the Royal Berkshire club and as graduate of the CHEK institute had firm beliefs about the benefits of functional training but also supporting clients in a more holistic way to help them achieve their goals. So very much a 1:1 training approach. Group exercise classes were often aimed at the more experienced individuals and in a class of 30 it is almost impossible to provide the right coaching and support on technique and to structure a class to suit all abilities so many clients were giving up after just a few sessions or picking up injuries. James was always researching new ideas, techniques, equipment to introduce to his clients and was one of the early adopters of the stability ball developing many programmes built around this equipment and use of own body weight. It was during one of these research phases that James came across the science of rebounding – and he was blown away by not only the many scientifically proven benefits of bouncing on a high quality mini-trampoline, but also that it was low impact, was weight bearing, and it was possible to devise workout routines in a group setting that were truly inclusive. Everyone could do a rebounding class, regardless of age, gender or fitness level. Best of all it was such a FUN class most people did not even think of it as exercise! To shorten the story, James teamed up with one of his clients who was in the “I don’t like exercise” camp and after a short period working with a rebounder they teamed up to form the Rebound Fitness business. The rest is history. Rebound Fitness now sells it’s own high quality rebounders and accessories internationally and has a world class training programme for Instructors endorsed by CIMSPA and a massive library of workouts that are available Online Live and On Demand to customers. James continues to innovate and we have expanded our programme into Schools, to support adults & children with a wide range of additional needs through our flexi bounce programme in partnership with ReboundTherapy.org, and are embarking on taking rebound fitness into retirement and care homes.

In 1993 he set up the UK’s first full time Rebound Therapy centre. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul’s passion and now teamed with Rebound Fitness can offer this fantastic therapy on mini-trampolines in their own homes! Paul is the CEO of Rebound Therapy International Ltd (operates under the name ReboundTherapy.org), an international training course tutor, conference speaker and consultant. Paul is the son of professional entertainers and started work at the age of 3 as an actor in TV commercials. At the age of 11 he found two new loves: gymnastics and music. In 1977 at the age of 18 he took his first gymnastic coaching course which was quickly followed by trampoline coaching and more advanced coaching courses. At the same age he started making his living as a gymnastic and trampoline coach and as a professional drummer and singer. He spent the next 15 years as a freelance mainstream and disabilities coach for schools and clubs, and as an entertainer. In 1992, Paul met Shirley Minter (now Shirley Kaye). Shirley was an international trampoline performer and experienced coach. The same year, Paul and Shirley set up a gymnastic and trampoline club, calling it the Saturn V Gym Club. This grew rapidly and by the year 2000 they had 9 branches with over 2500 members. One of the branches, which they set up in 1993 is a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. It is based in Caterham, Surrey, and is called the Saturn V Rebound Hall. The centre grew rapidly and within a year became the first full time centre of its kind in the UK. To this day it is still the model used by others who set up specialist disability centres.

In 1993 he set up the UK’s first full time Rebound Therapy centre. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul’s passion and now teamed with Rebound Fitness can offer this fantastic therapy on mini-trampolines in their own homes! Paul is the CEO of Rebound Therapy International Ltd (operates under the name ReboundTherapy.org), an international training course tutor, conference speaker and consultant. Paul is the son of professional entertainers and started work at the age of 3 as an actor in TV commercials. At the age of 11 he found two new loves: gymnastics and music. In 1977 at the age of 18 he took his first gymnastic coaching course which was quickly followed by trampoline coaching and more advanced coaching courses. At the same age he started making his living as a gymnastic and trampoline coach and as a professional drummer and singer. He spent the next 15 years as a freelance mainstream and disabilities coach for schools and clubs, and as an entertainer. In 1992, Paul met Shirley Minter (now Shirley Kaye). Shirley was an international trampoline performer and experienced coach. The same year, Paul and Shirley set up a gymnastic and trampoline club, calling it the Saturn V Gym Club. This grew rapidly and by the year 2000 they had 9 branches with over 2500 members. One of the branches, which they set up in 1993 is a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. It is based in Caterham, Surrey, and is called the Saturn V Rebound Hall. The centre grew rapidly and within a year became the first full time centre of its kind in the UK. To this day it is still the model used by others who set up specialist disability centres. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul and Shirley’s passion. In 2006, he and Shirley joined forces with Eddy Anderson (the founder of Rebound Therapy) and took on the responsibility of building the Rebound Therapy website (ReboundTherapy.org), formalising the development programme, and expanding the Rebound Therapy training course programme internationally. As Rebound Therapy developed, Paul and Shirley gave away their mainstream gymnastic and trampoline clubs to their most loyal coaches; all of whom had started with them as children and developed into coaches as they grew older. Paul now spends all his time working in Rebound Therapy. He and Shirley head a team of 11, comprising 9 training course tutors and 2 office staff.

Rebound Master Trainer Jess Lockhart I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again.

In 1993 he set up the UK’s first full time Rebound Therapy centre. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul’s passion and now teamed with Rebound Fitness can offer this fantastic therapy on mini-trampolines in their own homes! Paul is the CEO of Rebound Therapy International Ltd (operates under the name ReboundTherapy.org), an international training course tutor, conference speaker and consultant. Paul is the son of professional entertainers and started work at the age of 3 as an actor in TV commercials. At the age of 11 he found two new loves: gymnastics and music. In 1977 at the age of 18 he took his first gymnastic coaching course which was quickly followed by trampoline coaching and more advanced coaching courses. At the same age he started making his living as a gymnastic and trampoline coach and as a professional drummer and singer. He spent the next 15 years as a freelance mainstream and disabilities coach for schools and clubs, and as an entertainer. In 1992, Paul met Shirley Minter (now Shirley Kaye). Shirley was an international trampoline performer and experienced coach. The same year, Paul and Shirley set up a gymnastic and trampoline club, calling it the Saturn V Gym Club. This grew rapidly and by the year 2000 they had 9 branches with over 2500 members. One of the branches, which they set up in 1993 is a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. It is based in Caterham, Surrey, and is called the Saturn V Rebound Hall. The centre grew rapidly and within a year became the first full time centre of its kind in the UK. To this day it is still the model used by others who set up specialist disability centres. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul and Shirley’s passion. In 2006, he and Shirley joined forces with Eddy Anderson (the founder of Rebound Therapy) and took on the responsibility of building the Rebound Therapy website (ReboundTherapy.org), formalising the development programme, and expanding the Rebound Therapy training course programme internationally. As Rebound Therapy developed, Paul and Shirley gave away their mainstream gymnastic and trampoline clubs to their most loyal coaches; all of whom had started with them as children and developed into coaches as they grew older. Paul now spends all his time working in Rebound Therapy. He and Shirley head a team of 11, comprising 9 training course tutors and 2 office staff.

Rebound Master Trainer Jess Lockhart I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again.

Paul and Shirley’s plans for the future are to continue to grow Rebound Therapy worldwide so that as many people as possible with disabilities have access to the enormous benefits that Rebound Therapy can offer. Rebound Therapy is well established in the UK, and Paul has so far worked with governing bodies and eminent organisations to set up practitioner training centres in Australia, Canada, USA and South Africa. Paul and Shirley have four children between them. Their daughter Lois manages the Saturn V Rebound Hall and works as the Resources Director and online training course assessor for ReboundTherapy.org Of their three sons; the eldest, Neil, is a builder, the next one, Gavin is a film maker, and their youngest, Jamie has followed in the footsteps of Paul’s early career and is a professional entertainer having worked in musical theatre since the age of 11, including five years in London’s West End, a world tour, and he has also starred in a major Netflix series; The Alienist.

James is co-founder of Rebound Fitness and with over 25 years in the industry ensures we have the best Fitness Presenters to create exciting and motivating workouts and designs our high quality mini-trampolines. A regular contributor to national publications like Mens Fitness, Health & Fitness magazine and appearances on ITV’s Loose Women he works with a varied client base specializing in corrective exercise and high performance conditioning for athletes and fitness professionals. James specialised in assessing individual needs to ensure all round fitness and wellbeing, devising programs encompassing diet and nutrition, physical exercise, relaxation and time management. With a vast and varied client base he supported athletes and fitness professionals in corrective exercise, injury rehabilitation and high performance conditioning to help them achieve they goals. He also ran a team of Personal Trainers at the Royal Berkshire club and as graduate of the CHEK institute had firm beliefs about the benefits of functional training but also supporting clients in a more holistic way to help them achieve their goals. So very much a 1:1 training approach. Group exercise classes were often aimed at the more experienced individuals and in a class of 30 it is almost impossible to provide the right coaching and support on technique and to structure a class to suit all abilities so many clients were giving up after just a few sessions or picking up injuries. James was always researching new ideas, techniques, equipment to introduce to his clients and was one of the early adopters of the stability ball developing many programmes built around this equipment and use of own body weight. It was during one of these research phases that James came across the science of rebounding – and he was blown away by not only the many scientifically proven benefits of bouncing on a high quality mini-trampoline, but also that it was low impact, was weight bearing, and it was possible to devise workout routines in a group setting that were truly inclusive. Everyone could do a rebounding class, regardless of age, gender or fitness level. Best of all it was such a FUN class most people did not even think of it as exercise! To shorten the story, James teamed up with one of his clients who was in the “I don’t like exercise” camp and after a short period working with a rebounder they teamed up to form the Rebound Fitness business. The rest is history. Rebound Fitness now sells it’s own high quality rebounders and accessories internationally and has a world class training programme for Instructors endorsed by CIMSPA and a massive library of workouts that are available Online Live and On Demand to customers. James continues to innovate and we have expanded our programme into Schools, to support adults & children with a wide range of additional needs through our flexi bounce programme in partnership with ReboundTherapy.org, and are embarking on taking rebound fitness into retirement and care homes.

One of the branches, which they set up in 1993 is a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. It is based in Caterham, Surrey, and is called the Saturn V Rebound Hall. The centre grew rapidly and within a year became the first full time centre of its kind in the UK. To this day it is still the model used by others who set up specialist disability centres. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul and Shirley’s passion. In 2006, he and Shirley joined forces with Eddy Anderson (the founder of Rebound Therapy) and took on the responsibility of building the Rebound Therapy website (ReboundTherapy.org), formalising the development programme, and expanding the Rebound Therapy training course programme internationally. As Rebound Therapy developed, Paul and Shirley gave away their mainstream gymnastic and trampoline clubs to their most loyal coaches; all of whom had started with them as children and developed into coaches as they grew older. Paul now spends all his time working in Rebound Therapy. He and Shirley head a team of 11, comprising 9 training course tutors and 2 office staff.

Rebound Master Trainer Jess Lockhart I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again.

Paul and Shirley have four children between them.

A regular contributor to national publications like Mens Fitness, Health & Fitness magazine and appearances on ITV’s Loose Women he works with a varied client base specializing in corrective exercise and high performance conditioning for athletes and fitness professionals. James specialised in assessing individual needs to ensure all round fitness and wellbeing, devising programs encompassing diet and nutrition, physical exercise, relaxation and time management. With a vast and varied client base he supported athletes and fitness professionals in corrective exercise, injury rehabilitation and high performance conditioning to help them achieve they goals. He also ran a team of Personal Trainers at the Royal Berkshire club and as graduate of the CHEK institute had firm beliefs about the benefits of functional training but also supporting clients in a more holistic way to help them achieve their goals. So very much a 1:1 training approach. Group exercise classes were often aimed at the more experienced individuals and in a class of 30 it is almost impossible to provide the right coaching and support on technique and to structure a class to suit all abilities so many clients were giving up after just a few sessions or picking up injuries. James was always researching new ideas, techniques, equipment to introduce to his clients and was one of the early adopters of the stability ball developing many programmes built around this equipment and use of own body weight. It was during one of these research phases that James came across the science of rebounding – and he was blown away by not only the many scientifically proven benefits of bouncing on a high quality mini-trampoline, but also that it was low impact, was weight bearing, and it was possible to devise workout routines in a group setting that were truly inclusive. Everyone could do a rebounding class, regardless of age, gender or fitness level. Best of all it was such a FUN class most people did not even think of it as exercise! To shorten the story, James teamed up with one of his clients who was in the “I don’t like exercise” camp and after a short period working with a rebounder they teamed up to form the Rebound Fitness business. The rest is history. Rebound Fitness now sells it’s own high quality rebounders and accessories internationally and has a world class training programme for Instructors endorsed by CIMSPA and a massive library of workouts that are available Online Live and On Demand to customers. James continues to innovate and we have expanded our programme into Schools, to support adults & children with a wide range of additional needs through our flexi bounce programme in partnership with ReboundTherapy.org, and are embarking on taking rebound fitness into retirement and care homes.

She competed in trampolining from the age of 11 and was chosen for the England squad when she was just 16. When Shirley retired from competitive trampolining she became a trampoline coach and together with Paul set up the Saturn V Gym Club in 1993 together with a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. The Saturn V Rebound Hall based in Caterham, Surrey, became the first full time centre of its kind in the UK. To this day it is still the model used by others who set up specialist disability centres. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul and Shirley’s passion. In 2006, Shirley and Paul joined forces with Eddy Anderson (the founder of Rebound Therapy) and took on the responsibility of building the Rebound Therapy website (ReboundTherapy.org), formalising the development programme, and expanding the Rebound Therapy training course programme internationally. As Rebound Therapy developed, Shirley and Paul gave away their mainstream gymnastic and trampoline clubs to their most loyal coaches; all of whom had started with them as children and developed into coaches as they grew older. Paul and Shirley’s plans for the future are to continue to grow Rebound Therapy worldwide so that as many people as possible with disabilities have access to the enormous benefits that Rebound Therapy can offer. Rebound Therapy is well established in the UK, and Paul has so far worked with governing bodies and eminent organisations to set up practitioner training centres in Australia, Canada, USA and South Africa. Paul and Shirley have four children between them. Their daughter Lois manages the Saturn V Rebound Hall and works as the Resources Director and online training course assessor for ReboundTherapy.org Of their three sons; the eldest, Neil, is a builder, the next one, Gavin is a film maker, and their youngest, Jamie has followed in the footsteps of Paul’s early career and is a professional entertainer having worked in musical theatre since the age of 11, including five years in London’s West End, a world tour, and he has also starred in a major Netflix series; The Alienist. Co-Founder and Director James Winfield James is co-founder of Rebound Fitness and with over 25 years in the industry ensures we have the best Fitness Presenters to create exciting and motivating workouts and designs our high quality mini-trampolines.

James is co-founder of Rebound Fitness and with over 25 years in the industry ensures we have the best Fitness Presenters to create exciting and motivating workouts and designs our high quality mini-trampolines. A regular contributor to national publications like Mens Fitness, Health & Fitness magazine and appearances on ITV’s Loose Women he works with a varied client base specializing in corrective exercise and high performance conditioning for athletes and fitness professionals. James specialised in assessing individual needs to ensure all round fitness and wellbeing, devising programs encompassing diet and nutrition, physical exercise, relaxation and time management. With a vast and varied client base he supported athletes and fitness professionals in corrective exercise, injury rehabilitation and high performance conditioning to help them achieve they goals. He also ran a team of Personal Trainers at the Royal Berkshire club and as graduate of the CHEK institute had firm beliefs about the benefits of functional training but also supporting clients in a more holistic way to help them achieve their goals. So very much a 1:1 training approach. Group exercise classes were often aimed at the more experienced individuals and in a class of 30 it is almost impossible to provide the right coaching and support on technique and to structure a class to suit all abilities so many clients were giving up after just a few sessions or picking up injuries. James was always researching new ideas, techniques, equipment to introduce to his clients and was one of the early adopters of the stability ball developing many programmes built around this equipment and use of own body weight. It was during one of these research phases that James came across the science of rebounding – and he was blown away by not only the many scientifically proven benefits of bouncing on a high quality mini-trampoline, but also that it was low impact, was weight bearing, and it was possible to devise workout routines in a group setting that were truly inclusive. Everyone could do a rebounding class, regardless of age, gender or fitness level. Best of all it was such a FUN class most people did not even think of it as exercise! To shorten the story, James teamed up with one of his clients who was in the “I don’t like exercise” camp and after a short period working with a rebounder they teamed up to form the Rebound Fitness business. The rest is history. Rebound Fitness now sells it’s own high quality rebounders and accessories internationally and has a world class training programme for Instructors endorsed by CIMSPA and a massive library of workouts that are available Online Live and On Demand to customers. James continues to innovate and we have expanded our programme into Schools, to support adults & children with a wide range of additional needs through our flexi bounce programme in partnership with ReboundTherapy.org, and are embarking on taking rebound fitness into retirement and care homes.

Rebound Master Trainer Jess Lockhart I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again.

It was during one of these research phases that James came across the science of rebounding – and he was blown away by not only the many scientifically proven benefits of bouncing on a high quality mini-trampoline, but also that it was low impact, was weight bearing, and it was possible to devise workout routines in a group setting that were truly inclusive. Everyone could do a rebounding class, regardless of age, gender or fitness level. Best of all it was such a FUN class most people did not even think of it as exercise! To shorten the story, James teamed up with one of his clients who was in the “I don’t like exercise” camp and after a short period working with a rebounder they teamed up to form the Rebound Fitness business. The rest is history. Rebound Fitness now sells it’s own high quality rebounders and accessories internationally and has a world class training programme for Instructors endorsed by CIMSPA and a massive library of workouts that are available Online Live and On Demand to customers. James continues to innovate and we have expanded our programme into Schools, to support adults & children with a wide range of additional needs through our flexi bounce programme in partnership with ReboundTherapy.org, and are embarking on taking rebound fitness into retirement and care homes.

Her programme "Train like a Woman" is internationally recognised and clients from all over the world join her online Zoom classes. The Train like a Woman method teaches women how to execute perfect form with each and every exercise which is key to muscle adaptations. The exercises are multi-dimensional, thereby working the larger muscle groups as well as the deep stabilizing muscles, getting to the core of the abs and every other muscle, especially those “mummy bits”. After just a few short sessions you will honestly feel tight, toned, smaller and firmer. Jenni is passionate about helping others achieve their personal best and rebounding is a firm favourite with her clients!

A committed office bound, “I don’t like exercise” person who was always complaining of not having time to train found herself hooked on this time efficient, effective workout and as her overall health and fitness levels improved became a firm convert and advocate for Rebounding to health. Heather and James teamed up to develop the Rebound Fitness business combining skills and expertise in the design of high quality, safe & cost effective equipment with creative & innovate exercise programmes to engage consumer interest, with sales & marketing and back office business skills to build the business we have today. With both of us working alongside the “day job” the first few years targeted the UK gym market with launches in flagship clubs for Esporta, Virgin Active, DC Leisure to name a few. Then came the schools launch in 2007 with the Governments “Every Child Matters” initiative and funding leading up to the 2012 Olympics. Soon recognizing that only around 15% of the population hold a Gym membership we turned our attention to developing DVD workouts and home rebounder equipment and launching this on Amazon triggered our international expansion. Now working full-time in the Rebound Fitness business Heather is passionate about Rebounding and ensuring that the people who can benefit the most from rebounding are aware of the benefits and can access the equipment and workouts they need. With James she continues to reach for new markets either directly, or through partnerships such as with ReboundTherapy.org and JDK Fitness. She also finds the time to do “Nana duties” as you will see from the photo of her getting in her workout with the support of her Grandson Jude!

In 1993 he set up the UK’s first full time Rebound Therapy centre. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul’s passion and now teamed with Rebound Fitness can offer this fantastic therapy on mini-trampolines in their own homes! Paul is the CEO of Rebound Therapy International Ltd (operates under the name ReboundTherapy.org), an international training course tutor, conference speaker and consultant. Paul is the son of professional entertainers and started work at the age of 3 as an actor in TV commercials. At the age of 11 he found two new loves: gymnastics and music. In 1977 at the age of 18 he took his first gymnastic coaching course which was quickly followed by trampoline coaching and more advanced coaching courses. At the same age he started making his living as a gymnastic and trampoline coach and as a professional drummer and singer. He spent the next 15 years as a freelance mainstream and disabilities coach for schools and clubs, and as an entertainer. In 1992, Paul met Shirley Minter (now Shirley Kaye). Shirley was an international trampoline performer and experienced coach. The same year, Paul and Shirley set up a gymnastic and trampoline club, calling it the Saturn V Gym Club. This grew rapidly and by the year 2000 they had 9 branches with over 2500 members. One of the branches, which they set up in 1993 is a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. It is based in Caterham, Surrey, and is called the Saturn V Rebound Hall.

Rebound Master Trainer Jess Lockhart I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. After a 16 year long career in the Fitness and Leisure industry, I’ve done lots, tried lots and even come back with even more enthusiasm before. Going back a little bit….. In August 2017, we welcomed Luna in to the World. Like most new Mum’s, I couldn’t wait to get back in to shape, back to my pre-baby body and back in to those jeans! So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again.

So I went and tried a Bounce and Burn class when she was just 6 weeks old. I fell in love…. So much so, I came home and ordered 20 trampolines and set up my own classes (even after having a good 5 years not teaching at all). I’ve never looked back. I even bounced until I was 8 months pregnant with Eva, who was born in February 2019. I’ve seen first hand how amazing a mini trampoline workout is, not just for me but for everyone who’s been coming along and having great fun with me. I love seeing change, goals being smashed, confidence being lifted and just huge smiles from having fun. After going Virtual earlier this year, Bounce has gone from strength to strength and we’re seeing so many more people taking part and actually enjoying fitness again.

Shirley is an international training course tutor and consultant for Rebound Therapy, and their Finance Director. She competed in trampolining from the age of 11 and was chosen for the England squad when she was just 16. When Shirley retired from competitive trampolining she became a trampoline coach and together with Paul set up the Saturn V Gym Club in 1993 together with a specialist centre for disability trampolining and Rebound Therapy. The Saturn V Rebound Hall based in Caterham, Surrey, became the first full time centre of its kind in the UK. To this day it is still the model used by others who set up specialist disability centres. Working with people with disabilities and making a difference to their lives became Paul and Shirley’s passion. In 2006, Shirley and Paul joined forces with Eddy Anderson (the founder of Rebound Therapy) and took on the responsibility of building the Rebound Therapy website (ReboundTherapy.org), formalising the development programme, and expanding the Rebound Therapy training course programme internationally. As Rebound Therapy developed, Shirley and Paul gave away their mainstream gymnastic and trampoline clubs to their most loyal coaches; all of whom had started with them as children and developed into coaches as they grew older. Paul and Shirley’s plans for the future are to continue to grow Rebound Therapy worldwide so that as many people as possible with disabilities have access to the enormous benefits that Rebound Therapy can offer. Rebound Therapy is well established in the UK, and Paul has so far worked with governing bodies and eminent organisations to set up practitioner training centres in Australia, Canada, USA and South Africa. Paul and Shirley have four children between them. Their daughter Lois manages the Saturn V Rebound Hall and works as the Resources Director and online training course assessor for ReboundTherapy.org Of their three sons; the eldest, Neil, is a builder, the next one, Gavin is a film maker, and their youngest, Jamie has followed in the footsteps of Paul’s early career and is a professional entertainer having worked in musical theatre since the age of 11, including five years in London’s West End, a world tour, and he has also starred in a major Netflix series; The Alienist.

A regular contributor to national publications like Mens Fitness, Health & Fitness magazine and appearances on ITV’s Loose Women he works with a varied client base specializing in corrective exercise and high performance conditioning for athletes and fitness professionals. James specialised in assessing individual needs to ensure all round fitness and wellbeing, devising programs encompassing diet and nutrition, physical exercise, relaxation and time management. With a vast and varied client base he supported athletes and fitness professionals in corrective exercise, injury rehabilitation and high performance conditioning to help them achieve they goals. He also ran a team of Personal Trainers at the Royal Berkshire club and as graduate of the CHEK institute had firm beliefs about the benefits of functional training but also supporting clients in a more holistic way to help them achieve their goals. So very much a 1:1 training approach. Group exercise classes were often aimed at the more experienced individuals and in a class of 30 it is almost impossible to provide the right coaching and support on technique and to structure a class to suit all abilities so many clients were giving up after just a few sessions or picking up injuries. James was always researching new ideas, techniques, equipment to introduce to his clients and was one of the early adopters of the stability ball developing many programmes built around this equipment and use of own body weight. It was during one of these research phases that James came across the science of rebounding – and he was blown away by not only the many scientifically proven benefits of bouncing on a high quality mini-trampoline, but also that it was low impact, was weight bearing, and it was possible to devise workout routines in a group setting that were truly inclusive. Everyone could do a rebounding class, regardless of age, gender or fitness level. Best of all it was such a FUN class most people did not even think of it as exercise! To shorten the story, James teamed up with one of his clients who was in the “I don’t like exercise” camp and after a short period working with a rebounder they teamed up to form the Rebound Fitness business. The rest is history. Rebound Fitness now sells it’s own high quality rebounders and accessories internationally and has a world class training programme for Instructors endorsed by CIMSPA and a massive library of workouts that are available Online Live and On Demand to customers. James continues to innovate and we have expanded our programme into Schools, to support adults & children with a wide range of additional needs through our flexi bounce programme in partnership with ReboundTherapy.org, and are embarking on taking rebound fitness into retirement and care homes.

Her programme "Train like a Woman" is internationally recognised and clients from all over the world join her online Zoom classes. The Train like a Woman method teaches women how to execute perfect form with each and every exercise which is key to muscle adaptations. The exercises are multi-dimensional, thereby working the larger muscle groups as well as the deep stabilizing muscles, getting to the core of the abs and every other muscle, especially those “mummy bits”. After just a few short sessions you will honestly feel tight, toned, smaller and firmer.

James specialised in assessing individual needs to ensure all round fitness and wellbeing, devising programs encompassing diet and nutrition, physical exercise, relaxation and time management. With a vast and varied client base he supported athletes and fitness professionals in corrective exercise, injury rehabilitation and high performance conditioning to help them achieve they goals. He also ran a team of Personal Trainers at the Royal Berkshire club and as graduate of the CHEK institute had firm beliefs about the benefits of functional training but also supporting clients in a more holistic way to help them achieve their goals. So very much a 1:1 training approach. Group exercise classes were often aimed at the more experienced individuals and in a class of 30 it is almost impossible to provide the right coaching and support on technique and to structure a class to suit all abilities so many clients were giving up after just a few sessions or picking up injuries. James was always researching new ideas, techniques, equipment to introduce to his clients and was one of the early adopters of the stability ball developing many programmes built around this equipment and use of own body weight. It was during one of these research phases that James came across the science of rebounding – and he was blown away by not only the many scientifically proven benefits of bouncing on a high quality mini-trampoline, but also that it was low impact, was weight bearing, and it was possible to devise workout routines in a group setting that were truly inclusive. Everyone could do a rebounding class, regardless of age, gender or fitness level. Best of all it was such a FUN class most people did not even think of it as exercise! To shorten the story, James teamed up with one of his clients who was in the “I don’t like exercise” camp and after a short period working with a rebounder they teamed up to form the Rebound Fitness business. The rest is history. Rebound Fitness now sells it’s own high quality rebounders and accessories internationally and has a world class training programme for Instructors endorsed by CIMSPA and a massive library of workouts that are available Online Live and On Demand to customers. James continues to innovate and we have expanded our programme into Schools, to support adults & children with a wide range of additional needs through our flexi bounce programme in partnership with ReboundTherapy.org, and are embarking on taking rebound fitness into retirement and care homes.

A committed office bound, “I don’t like exercise” person who was always complaining of not having time to train found herself hooked on this time efficient, effective workout and as her overall health and fitness levels improved became a firm convert and advocate for Rebounding to health. Heather and James teamed up to develop the Rebound Fitness business combining skills and expertise in the design of high quality, safe & cost effective equipment with creative & innovate exercise programmes to engage consumer interest, with sales & marketing and back office business skills to build the business we have today. With both of us working alongside the “day job” the first few years targeted the UK gym market with launches in flagship clubs for Esporta, Virgin Active, DC Leisure to name a few. Then came the schools launch in 2007 with the Governments “Every Child Matters” initiative and funding leading up to the 2012 Olympics. Soon recognizing that only around 15% of the population hold a Gym membership we turned our attention to developing DVD workouts and home rebounder equipment and launching this on Amazon triggered our international expansion. Now working full-time in the Rebound Fitness business Heather is passionate about Rebounding and ensuring that the people who can benefit the most from rebounding are aware of the benefits and can access the equipment and workouts they need. With James she continues to reach for new markets either directly, or through partnerships such as with ReboundTherapy.org and JDK Fitness. She also finds the time to do “Nana duties” as you will see from the photo of her getting in her workout with the support of her Grandson Jude!
