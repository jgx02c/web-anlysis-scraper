You will find the full specifications for each rebounder in the product description for each rebounder.  Broadly, Yes! Unlike many Rebounders on the market, all Rebound Fitness’ rebounders come with a full spare parts service. We have worked tirelessly to ensure that our equipment is manufactured to the highest quality and is as robust as possible, however, sometimes even a rebounder can tweak a hamstring!  Every component of our rebounders is replaceable so should anything happen to a spring (or bungee), mat, rubber feet, leg or a skirt we stock replacements so you don’t have to buy a whole new rebounder. To order spare or replacement parts pleasevisit our shop. We offer both spring and bungee model rebounders – they both have a place in the rebounding market and this blog will help you to understand the differences between the two designs and assist you in making the right choice for your needs –“Bungee or Spring Rebounder – What is the Difference?” We have a range of Rebounders to suit different budgets and uses.  This blog provides a useful comparison –“Which Rebounder should I buy?”.

Home » About Rebounding » Rebounding FAQs Rebounding FAQs No question is a silly question! Here’s a list of our most frequently asked questions. About Our Rebounders How big are the Rebounders? You will find the full specifications for each rebounder in the product description for each rebounder.  Broadly, The frame is approx. 40 inches in diameter, the mat surface is approx. 27 inches in diameter. The rebounders stand 10-13 inches from the ground. The stability bar stands approx. 35 inches from the mat surface. What are the maximum user weights? Fit Bounce Pro = 330lbs /150kgs Fit Bounce Pro XL = 330lbs /150kgs Maximus Pro Bungee = 330lbs /150kgs Maximus Pro Gym Rebounder = 330lbs /150kgs Maximus Pro Rebounder = 330lbs /150kgs HIIT Bounce Pro = 308lbs /140kgs Bounce & Burn = 308lbs /140kgs Do the Rebounders make any noise? All bungee model rebounders are very quiet, For metal sprung rebounders, there will always be a slight noise as you have “metal on metal” whilst bouncing, however, proper maintenance of metal sprung rebounders keep this to a minimum.  Every few months, simply apply vaseline (or coconut oil) to the springs where any metal component contacts another metal component and this will reduce the noise level. Should I wear trainers when using the Rebounder? Bungee models – These rebounders are springless and can be used barefoot (we recommend our grip socks for comfort) or with cross trainers. All spring based Rebounders should be used wearing trainers – preferably cross trainers with a stiff midsole.  Avoid tying shoes too tightly to enable increased blood circulation in the feet. Do you offer a spare parts service? Yes! Unlike many Rebounders on the market, all Rebound Fitness’ rebounders come with a full spare parts service.

To achieve all the benefits possible from Rebounding, purchase a Rebound Fitness rebounder and follow our recommended bouncing technique – guaranteed to put a smile on your face! Perfect bounce – a controlled downward push into the mat, not jumping high/slow as trampolining Land through balls of feet, then heel, stay close to the mat with low centre of gravity Core and postural muscles will engage automatically Controlled rhythmic bounce, working against gravity, feels incredible, massive calorie burn!

Here’s a list of our most frequently asked questions. About Our Rebounders How big are the Rebounders? You will find the full specifications for each rebounder in the product description for each rebounder.  Broadly, The frame is approx. 40 inches in diameter, the mat surface is approx. 27 inches in diameter. The rebounders stand 10-13 inches from the ground. The stability bar stands approx. 35 inches from the mat surface. What are the maximum user weights? Fit Bounce Pro = 330lbs /150kgs Fit Bounce Pro XL = 330lbs /150kgs Maximus Pro Bungee = 330lbs /150kgs Maximus Pro Gym Rebounder = 330lbs /150kgs Maximus Pro Rebounder = 330lbs /150kgs HIIT Bounce Pro = 308lbs /140kgs Bounce & Burn = 308lbs /140kgs Do the Rebounders make any noise? All bungee model rebounders are very quiet, For metal sprung rebounders, there will always be a slight noise as you have “metal on metal” whilst bouncing, however, proper maintenance of metal sprung rebounders keep this to a minimum.  Every few months, simply apply vaseline (or coconut oil) to the springs where any metal component contacts another metal component and this will reduce the noise level. Should I wear trainers when using the Rebounder? Bungee models – These rebounders are springless and can be used barefoot (we recommend our grip socks for comfort) or with cross trainers. All spring based Rebounders should be used wearing trainers – preferably cross trainers with a stiff midsole.  Avoid tying shoes too tightly to enable increased blood circulation in the feet.

To achieve all the benefits possible from Rebounding, purchase a Rebound Fitness rebounder and follow our recommended bouncing technique – guaranteed to put a smile on your face! Perfect bounce – a controlled downward push into the mat, not jumping high/slow as trampolining Land through balls of feet, then heel, stay close to the mat with low centre of gravity Core and postural muscles will engage automatically Controlled rhythmic bounce, working against gravity, feels incredible, massive calorie burn! Every cell in the body feels a gentle squeeze giving you a workout from the inside out! Momentarily defying gravity creates a feeling of free-falling giving a feel good endorphin release About Our Rebounders About Our Rebounders How big are the Rebounders? You will find the full specifications for each rebounder in the product description for each rebounder.  Broadly, The frame is approx. 40 inches in diameter, the mat surface is approx. 27 inches in diameter. The rebounders stand 10-13 inches from the ground. The stability bar stands approx. 35 inches from the mat surface. What are the maximum user weights? Fit Bounce Pro = 330lbs /150kgs Fit Bounce Pro XL = 330lbs /150kgs Maximus Pro Bungee = 330lbs /150kgs Maximus Pro Gym Rebounder = 330lbs /150kgs Maximus Pro Rebounder = 330lbs /150kgs HIIT Bounce Pro = 308lbs /140kgs Bounce & Burn = 308lbs /140kgs Do the Rebounders make any noise? All bungee model rebounders are very quiet, For metal sprung rebounders, there will always be a slight noise as you have “metal on metal” whilst bouncing, however, proper maintenance of metal sprung rebounders keep this to a minimum.  Every few months, simply apply vaseline (or coconut oil) to the springs where any metal component contacts another metal component and this will reduce the noise level. Should I wear trainers when using the Rebounder? Bungee models – These rebounders are springless and can be used barefoot (we recommend our grip socks for comfort) or with cross trainers. All spring based Rebounders should be used wearing trainers – preferably cross trainers with a stiff midsole.  Avoid tying shoes too tightly to enable increased blood circulation in the feet.

We have worked tirelessly to ensure that our equipment is manufactured to the highest quality and is as robust as possible, however, sometimes even a rebounder can tweak a hamstring!  Every component of our rebounders is replaceable so should anything happen to a spring (or bungee), mat, rubber feet, leg or a skirt we stock replacements so you don’t have to buy a whole new rebounder. To order spare or replacement parts please visit our sho p . What is the difference between a Spring and Bungee rebounder?
