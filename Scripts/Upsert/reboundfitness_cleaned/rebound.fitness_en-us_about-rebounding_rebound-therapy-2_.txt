    Home»About Rebounding»Rebound Therapy ReboundTherapy.org have approved the use of the Fit Bounce Pro orthopaedic quality mini-trampoline for Flexi-Bounce Therapy; a comprehensive graded exercise and development programme for children and adults across a wide spectrum of additional needs. For use by Schools, Parents/Carers in the home and by specialist practitioners. “Rebound Therapyis exercise therapy which uses a full-sized trampoline to provide opportunities for movement, therapeutic exercise and recreation for people across virtually the whole spectrum of special needs”; E.G.Anderson, Founder of Rebound Therapy – www.reboundtherapy.org, the official UK body, Worldwide Federation and Consultancy responsible for the development and provision of certified and accredited training courses and development of overseas training partners. Flexi-Bouncewas developed by the ReboundTherapy.org team and is the perfect complement to Rebound Therapy. It can be used by Parents/Carers as a stand alone activity at home or 1:1 by a specialist practitioner or centre, or as an “in between sessions” complement to scheduled Rebound Therapy sessions. There are two pathways through the training. Flexi Bounce for Confidence is for more independent children and Flexi Bounce Therapy for those who require more hands-on support. Rebound Fitness has developed the orthopaedic quality Fit Bounce Pro rebounders which are approved by ReboundTherapy.org for Flexi-Bounce use. Include Children and Young People with SEND in Rebounding classes alongside children who do not have SEND needs.  Builds confidence and coordination skills for students who are new to regular exercise. For Children and Young People with SEND needs who require physical support to help them bounce or to keep them focussed on the rebounder. Many parents/carers of children with additional needs have experienced the benefits of Rebound Therapy which uses a full-sized trampoline to provide opportunities for movement, therapeutic exercise and recreation for people across virtually the whole spectrum of special needs.  Due to the equipment needs these sessions are often infrequent, or there may be areas of the country that just don’t have the funding or space for full size trampolines. Flexi Bounce at Home allows the parent/carer to support the child to get many of the benefits every single day by using an orthopaedic quality rebounder from Rebound Fitness and accessing FREE the Flexi Bounce Home Use online programme developed by ReboundTherapy.org. Keep reading to learn about the many benefits of Flexi Bounce and testimonials from customers. ”Rebound Fitness has developed the orthopaedic quality Fit Bounce Pro XL rebounder which has been approved by ReboundTherapy.org for Flexi-Bounce Therapy. These are the properties that ReboundTherapy.Org look for and have assessed in approving the Fit Bounce Pro for use with their Flexi Bounce Therapy programme: Unique Three-foldeffect on body organs, systems and muscles. Storage of potential energyas the trampoline bed is under tension with springs it is a potential energy source. Output of energy–  this varies according to the energy put in; the bed stores the input energy unto output. As in Newton’s 3rd Law of Motion. ‘for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction’. Potential for liftinga body into space – as a result of the storage of enery, the trampoline bed, when energised, has the potential for lifting a body into space. The amount of energy required will relate to the weight of the body to be lifted. Potential for initiating movementin a body from a distance – the input of energy can be at any point yet still produce output throughout the trampoline bed. However, that output is most effective from the centre of the trampoline bed. The technique of ‘popping’ uses this property to initiate control and movement. Unstable surface– the surface, which is elasticated and under spring tension, is unstable and movement on it acts to energise the bed. Output from this movement causes the bed to offer an active base upon which movement occurs. Damping– this is the absorption of the energy of the bed by the body. It is achieved by taking up some of the energy of the bed through flexed hips and knees. Variable Surface– the surface is changeable and can be deliberately arranged to enhance symmetry and to promote symmetrical weight-bearing, thus encouraging balance. These are the Physiological Effects of Flexi -BounceTherapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: Cardio-Respiratory:There is a highdemand on muscles to deal with the increased gravity produced on deceleration and in the control of movement required when gravity is in effect reduced, as in acceleration, causing an increase in the respiratory rate and subsequently the heart rate. As a direct consequence there is an upturn in venous and lymphatic drainage. The constant muscle work required to maintain position and balance increases the demand for oxygen. Muscle Tone: In simplistic terms, trampolining generally causes an increase in postural muscle tone, simple to prevent falling over. In Rebound Therapy, the effect on muscle tone hypertonia or hypotonia is variable. Low amplitive bouncing in general causes a reducing effect on hypertonia by bombarding the muscle spindle in much the same way as shaking causes a decrease in muscle tone. High amplitude bouncing can cause an increase in tone by stimulating the stretch receptors. The two properties can be used therefore to increase or decrease tone where required. The effect of the rebound activity on muscle tone can easily be observed in people with spasticity, either hemiplegic or athetoid, or by effect on ataxia where tone can be seen to undergo change. Postural Mechanism: Stimulating by bombarding the sensory systems through joints, muscle and skin can improve the output to the important postural muscles. Balance Mechanism: In creating a dynamic movement situation, so challenging balance mechanisms, observable improvement can be achieved. This is particularly relevant when working with adults where a dynamic balance situation is difficult to create in lying, sitting or kneeling. Kinaesthetic Awareness: By the multiple stimulation of joints, pressure stretch receptors, skin, muscles etc., kinaesthetic awareness is improved, leading to improved body image and spatial awareness. These are the Therapeutic Effects of Flexi-Bounce Therapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: ON MOVEMENT: Movement can befacilitated at different stages of the bounce. The most active movement takes place at the top of the bounce where acceleration of the body equals the downthrust of gravity to allow a momentary “gravity-free” zone. A tiny body movement can produce a large effect with correctly applied bounce. Momentum and rhythm can be added to movement to help teach new movement skills and energise movement. Balance and equilibrium reactions can be achieved through stimulation of postural mechanisms; by creating a dynamic movement situation, protective and saving reactions can be developed. The anticipation of movement occurs because of the effects of timing, rhythm and momentum. An inhibiting or stimulating effect on muscle tone enables active movement to take place. By using good positioning and low amplitude bouncing, good relaxation is easily obtained. ON PERCEPTION:Body image, bodypart awareness and positional sense are enhanced through tactile and joint sensation. Increased perception of body image, spatial awareness combined with rhythm, and movement itself, greatly develop co-ordination. The experience of movement into space with the return to stability, while remaining in control, provides an enriched learning experience, for the motor-impaired person. ON COMMUNICATION:Due to cardio-respiratoryeffects, vocalisation is increased – with exclamations and gasps. Eye contact and concentration are enhanced by the “focus effect”. There are many emotional and physical demands of caring for an individual with a disability and indeed on the whole family which is often not addressed.  Parents and other family members feel that they just have to “get on with it” when in reality they need to be looking after themselves physically and emotionally in order to continue to provide the best care they can. This article by Angela Kelly from the“the special needs jungle”is particularly interesting and speaks about the many studies that have been conducted to highlight the risk to mental health, including increased stress and anxiety, depression and other emotional strains. They also refer to a growing literature on the potential positive aspects of parenting a disabled child, including increased meaning or growth, finding benefit and positive perceptions given the right circumstances and when appropriate support is in place, and studies looking at the impact on the wider family, including grandparents, and siblings. Spending money to support an individual with additional needs is often something that Parents do willingly, or can obtain funding from the various support organisations that are around. Rebound Therapy is well established as a fantastic exercise routine to support Children and Young People and Adults with SEND needs and with the development of Flexi Bounce Therapy bouncing can now be incorporated into a daily routine. The same equipment can be used by Carers/Parents and all the other family members to ensure that they can exercise in the comfort of their own home, and improve their fitness levels, strengthen and tone their body for the physical demands of their caring role, and most importantly have some fun and improve mental wellbeing. “The rebounder is being used in school by a 13 year old boy who has limited communication and is at the lower functioning end of the autism spectrum. We use the rebounder with him at various times of the day. This helps break up his timetable and gives him his own space in between learning. He enjoys using it, and it can be particularly helpful if the pupil is becoming agitated or distressed to allow him some extra time on it. I have to say that the advice and support received from the company was second to none - they went out of their way to ensure the correct product was purchased. We are delighted with the Fit Bounce Pro and would highly recommend it.” “Rebound Fitness have designed an orthopaedic quality folding rebounder specifically for Flexi-Bounce Therapy - the Fit Bounce Pro XL. Its unique characteristic is that it folds in half which makes it easy to store and ideal for use in the home and by professionals such as Fitness Trainers, Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists, Personal Trainers etc. The Fit Bounce Pro XL has a slow, soft and virtually silent bounce due to the individual elastic springs. (Many rebounders have metal springs which can give a noisy, hard bounce.) and is one of only three orthopaedic quality rebounders worldwide that is recommended by Rebound Therapy International.” “I got this rebounder for my son who is 15 with autism. His condition means he needs to bounce frequently to regulate his sensory system and to expend energy, so we have always had some type of mini trampoline in our living room. We needed a strong rebounder & the Fit Bounce Pro fits the bill perfectly as it is very quiet which is a big bonus for us as a family as it is in our living room and in use so frequently. I myself have hypermobile joints so an added bonus of being beneficial to me also and not just my son.” Customer Serviceservice@rebound.fitnessTel:+44 (0) 333 444 0846Tel:001 (262) 217 0846 Media Enquiries:service@rebound.fitness   Website byWe Are Flamingo|Privacy Policy|Terms & Conditions © 2025 Rebound Fitness.

Low amplitive bouncing in general causes a reducing effect on hypertonia by bombarding the muscle spindle in much the same way as shaking causes a decrease in muscle tone. High amplitude bouncing can cause an increase in tone by stimulating the stretch receptors. The two properties can be used therefore to increase or decrease tone where required. The effect of the rebound activity on muscle tone can easily be observed in people with spasticity, either hemiplegic or athetoid, or by effect on ataxia where tone can be seen to undergo change. Postural Mechanism : Stimulating by bombarding the sensory systems through joints, muscle and skin can improve the output to the important postural muscles. Balance Mechanism : In creating a dynamic movement situation, so challenging balance mechanisms, observable improvement can be achieved. This is particularly relevant when working with adults where a dynamic balance situation is difficult to create in lying, sitting or kneeling. Kinaesthetic Awareness : By the multiple stimulation of joints, pressure stretch receptors, skin, muscles etc., kinaesthetic awareness is improved, leading to improved body image and spatial awareness. Got a Question? Therapeutic effects of Flexi Bounce These are the Therapeutic Effects of Flexi-Bounce Therapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: ON MOVEMENT : Movement can be facilitated at different stages of the bounce. The most active movement takes place at the top of the bounce where acceleration of the body equals the downthrust of gravity to allow a momentary “gravity-free” zone. A tiny body movement can produce a large effect with correctly applied bounce. Momentum and rhythm can be added to movement to help teach new movement skills and energise movement. Balance and equilibrium reactions can be achieved through stimulation of postural mechanisms; by creating a dynamic movement situation, protective and saving reactions can be developed. The anticipation of movement occurs because of the effects of timing, rhythm and momentum. An inhibiting or stimulating effect on muscle tone enables active movement to take place. By using good positioning and low amplitude bouncing, good relaxation is easily obtained. ON PERCEPTION : Body image, body part awareness and positional sense are enhanced through tactile and joint sensation. Increased perception of body image, spatial awareness combined with rhythm, and movement itself, greatly develop co-ordination. The experience of movement into space with the return to stability, while remaining in control, provides an enriched learning experience, for the motor-impaired person. ON COMMUNICATION : Due to cardio-respiratory effects, vocalisation is increased – with exclamations and gasps. Eye contact and concentration are enhanced by the “focus effect”. Request more information Caring for the Carers There are many emotional and physical demands of caring for an individual with a disability and indeed on the whole family which is often not addressed.  Parents and other family members feel that they just have to “get on with it” when in reality they need to be looking after themselves physically and emotionally in order to continue to provide the best care they can. This article by Angela Kelly from the “the special needs jungle” is particularly interesting and speaks about the many studies that have been conducted to highlight the risk to mental health, including increased stress and anxiety, depression and other emotional strains. They also refer to a growing literature on the potential positive aspects of parenting a disabled child, including increased meaning or growth, finding benefit and positive perceptions given the right circumstances and when appropriate support is in place, and studies looking at the impact on the wider family, including grandparents, and siblings. Spending money to support an individual with additional needs is often something that Parents do willingly, or can obtain funding from the various support organisations that are around. Rebound Therapy is well established as a fantastic exercise routine to support Children and Young People and Adults with SEND needs and with the development of Flexi Bounce Therapy bouncing can now be incorporated into a daily routine. The same equipment can be used by Carers/Parents and all the other family members to ensure that they can exercise in the comfort of their own home, and improve their fitness levels, strengthen and tone their body for the physical demands of their caring role, and most importantly have some fun and improve mental wellbeing. Treat the whole family! What Flexi Bounce Customers have to say ... “ The rebounder is being used in school by a 13 year old boy who has limited communication and is at the lower functioning end of the autism spectrum. We use the rebounder with him at various times of the day. This helps break up his timetable and gives him his own space in between learning. He enjoys using it, and it can be particularly helpful if the pupil is becoming agitated or distressed to allow him some extra time on it. I have to say that the advice and support received from the company was second to none - they went out of their way to ensure the correct product was purchased. We are delighted with the Fit Bounce Pro and would highly recommend it. ” Amazon Customer Special Needs School; Feb 2016 “ Rebound Fitness have designed an orthopaedic quality folding rebounder specifically for Flexi-Bounce Therapy - the Fit Bounce Pro XL. Its unique characteristic is that it folds in half which makes it easy to store and ideal for use in the home and by professionals such as Fitness Trainers, Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists, Personal Trainers etc. The Fit Bounce Pro XL has a slow, soft and virtually silent bounce due to the individual elastic springs. (Many rebounders have metal springs which can give a noisy, hard bounce.) and is one of only three orthopaedic quality rebounders worldwide that is recommended by Rebound Therapy International. ” Paul Kaye Rebound Therapy.Org - CEO “ I got this rebounder for my son who is 15 with autism. His condition means he needs to bounce frequently to regulate his sensory system and to expend energy, so we have always had some type of mini trampoline in our living room. We needed a strong rebounder & the Fit Bounce Pro fits the bill perfectly as it is very quiet which is a big bonus for us as a family as it is in our living room and in use so frequently. I myself have hypermobile joints so an added bonus of being beneficial to me also and not just my son. ” Amazon Customer Family in Ireland using at home Shop Buy your Rebounder Buy accessories Buy DVDs Buy spare parts Customer service Delivery and Returns Contact Klarna FAQs Instructor Training Become an instructor Book a course Meet our instructors About Rebounding The benefits of Rebounding Rebounding in gyms Rebounding for schools Rebounding FAQs Blog Contact us Customer Service service@rebound.fitness Tel: +44 (0) 333 444 0846 Tel: 001 (262) 217 0846 Media Enquiries: service@rebound.fitness Trustpilot Website by We Are Flamingo | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions © 2025 Rebound Fitness.

E.G.Anderson Founder of Rebound Therapy Orthopaedic Rebounder - Spec Physiological Benefits Therapeutic Benefits Caring for the Carers Properties of an Orthopaedic Rebounder These are the properties that ReboundTherapy.Org look for and have assessed in approving the Fit Bounce Pro for use with their Flexi Bounce Therapy programme: Unique Three-fold effect on body organs, systems and muscles. Weight increases and decreases to the point of weightlessness There is acceleration from stillness to varying speeds There is deceleration from  varying speeds to stillness. Storage of potential energy as the trampoline bed is under tension with springs it is a potential energy source. Output of energy –  this varies according to the energy put in; the bed stores the input energy unto output. As in Newton’s 3rd Law of Motion. ‘for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction’. Potential for lifting a body into space – as a result of the storage of enery, the trampoline bed, when energised, has the potential for lifting a body into space. The amount of energy required will relate to the weight of the body to be lifted. Potential for initiating movement in a body from a distance – the input of energy can be at any point yet still produce output throughout the trampoline bed. However, that output is most effective from the centre of the trampoline bed. The technique of ‘popping’ uses this property to initiate control and movement. Unstable surface – the surface, which is elasticated and under spring tension, is unstable and movement on it acts to energise the bed. Output from this movement causes the bed to offer an active base upon which movement occurs. Damping – this is the absorption of the energy of the bed by the body. It is achieved by taking up some of the energy of the bed through flexed hips and knees. Variable Surface – the surface is changeable and can be deliberately arranged to enhance symmetry and to promote symmetrical weight-bearing, thus encouraging balance. Buy Flexi Bounce At Home Physiological Effects and Benefits of Flexi Bounce These are the Physiological Effects of Flexi -BounceTherapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: Cardio-Respiratory : There is a high demand on muscles to deal with the increased gravity produced on deceleration and in the control of movement required when gravity is in effect reduced, as in acceleration, causing an increase in the respiratory rate and subsequently the heart rate. As a direct consequence there is an upturn in venous and lymphatic drainage. The constant muscle work required to maintain position and balance increases the demand for oxygen.

As in Newton’s 3rd Law of Motion. ‘for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction’. Potential for lifting a body into space – as a result of the storage of enery, the trampoline bed, when energised, has the potential for lifting a body into space. The amount of energy required will relate to the weight of the body to be lifted. Potential for initiating movement in a body from a distance – the input of energy can be at any point yet still produce output throughout the trampoline bed. However, that output is most effective from the centre of the trampoline bed. The technique of ‘popping’ uses this property to initiate control and movement. Unstable surface – the surface, which is elasticated and under spring tension, is unstable and movement on it acts to energise the bed. Output from this movement causes the bed to offer an active base upon which movement occurs. Damping – this is the absorption of the energy of the bed by the body. It is achieved by taking up some of the energy of the bed through flexed hips and knees. Variable Surface – the surface is changeable and can be deliberately arranged to enhance symmetry and to promote symmetrical weight-bearing, thus encouraging balance. Buy Flexi Bounce At Home Physiological Effects and Benefits of Flexi Bounce These are the Physiological Effects of Flexi -BounceTherapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: Cardio-Respiratory : There is a high demand on muscles to deal with the increased gravity produced on deceleration and in the control of movement required when gravity is in effect reduced, as in acceleration, causing an increase in the respiratory rate and subsequently the heart rate. As a direct consequence there is an upturn in venous and lymphatic drainage. The constant muscle work required to maintain position and balance increases the demand for oxygen. Muscle Tone : In simplistic terms, trampolining generally causes an increase in postural muscle tone, simple to prevent falling over. In Rebound Therapy, the effect on muscle tone hypertonia or hypotonia is variable. Low amplitive bouncing in general causes a reducing effect on hypertonia by bombarding the muscle spindle in much the same way as shaking causes a decrease in muscle tone. High amplitude bouncing can cause an increase in tone by stimulating the stretch receptors. The two properties can be used therefore to increase or decrease tone where required. The effect of the rebound activity on muscle tone can easily be observed in people with spasticity, either hemiplegic or athetoid, or by effect on ataxia where tone can be seen to undergo change. Postural Mechanism : Stimulating by bombarding the sensory systems through joints, muscle and skin can improve the output to the important postural muscles. Balance Mechanism : In creating a dynamic movement situation, so challenging balance mechanisms, observable improvement can be achieved. This is particularly relevant when working with adults where a dynamic balance situation is difficult to create in lying, sitting or kneeling. Kinaesthetic Awareness : By the multiple stimulation of joints, pressure stretch receptors, skin, muscles etc., kinaesthetic awareness is improved, leading to improved body image and spatial awareness. Got a Question? Therapeutic effects of Flexi Bounce These are the Therapeutic Effects of Flexi-Bounce Therapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: ON MOVEMENT : Movement can be facilitated at different stages of the bounce. The most active movement takes place at the top of the bounce where acceleration of the body equals the downthrust of gravity to allow a momentary “gravity-free” zone. A tiny body movement can produce a large effect with correctly applied bounce. Momentum and rhythm can be added to movement to help teach new movement skills and energise movement. Balance and equilibrium reactions can be achieved through stimulation of postural mechanisms; by creating a dynamic movement situation, protective and saving reactions can be developed. The anticipation of movement occurs because of the effects of timing, rhythm and momentum. An inhibiting or stimulating effect on muscle tone enables active movement to take place. By using good positioning and low amplitude bouncing, good relaxation is easily obtained. ON PERCEPTION : Body image, body part awareness and positional sense are enhanced through tactile and joint sensation. Increased perception of body image, spatial awareness combined with rhythm, and movement itself, greatly develop co-ordination. The experience of movement into space with the return to stability, while remaining in control, provides an enriched learning experience, for the motor-impaired person. ON COMMUNICATION : Due to cardio-respiratory effects, vocalisation is increased – with exclamations and gasps. Eye contact and concentration are enhanced by the “focus effect”. Request more information Caring for the Carers There are many emotional and physical demands of caring for an individual with a disability and indeed on the whole family which is often not addressed.  Parents and other family members feel that they just have to “get on with it” when in reality they need to be looking after themselves physically and emotionally in order to continue to provide the best care they can. This article by Angela Kelly from the “the special needs jungle” is particularly interesting and speaks about the many studies that have been conducted to highlight the risk to mental health, including increased stress and anxiety, depression and other emotional strains. They also refer to a growing literature on the potential positive aspects of parenting a disabled child, including increased meaning or growth, finding benefit and positive perceptions given the right circumstances and when appropriate support is in place, and studies looking at the impact on the wider family, including grandparents, and siblings. Spending money to support an individual with additional needs is often something that Parents do willingly, or can obtain funding from the various support organisations that are around. Rebound Therapy is well established as a fantastic exercise routine to support Children and Young People and Adults with SEND needs and with the development of Flexi Bounce Therapy bouncing can now be incorporated into a daily routine. The same equipment can be used by Carers/Parents and all the other family members to ensure that they can exercise in the comfort of their own home, and improve their fitness levels, strengthen and tone their body for the physical demands of their caring role, and most importantly have some fun and improve mental wellbeing. Treat the whole family! What Flexi Bounce Customers have to say ... “ The rebounder is being used in school by a 13 year old boy who has limited communication and is at the lower functioning end of the autism spectrum. We use the rebounder with him at various times of the day. This helps break up his timetable and gives him his own space in between learning. He enjoys using it, and it can be particularly helpful if the pupil is becoming agitated or distressed to allow him some extra time on it. I have to say that the advice and support received from the company was second to none - they went out of their way to ensure the correct product was purchased. We are delighted with the Fit Bounce Pro and would highly recommend it. ” Amazon Customer Special Needs School; Feb 2016 “ Rebound Fitness have designed an orthopaedic quality folding rebounder specifically for Flexi-Bounce Therapy - the Fit Bounce Pro XL. Its unique characteristic is that it folds in half which makes it easy to store and ideal for use in the home and by professionals such as Fitness Trainers, Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists, Personal Trainers etc. The Fit Bounce Pro XL has a slow, soft and virtually silent bounce due to the individual elastic springs. (Many rebounders have metal springs which can give a noisy, hard bounce.) and is one of only three orthopaedic quality rebounders worldwide that is recommended by Rebound Therapy International. ” Paul Kaye Rebound Therapy.Org - CEO “ I got this rebounder for my son who is 15 with autism. His condition means he needs to bounce frequently to regulate his sensory system and to expend energy, so we have always had some type of mini trampoline in our living room. We needed a strong rebounder & the Fit Bounce Pro fits the bill perfectly as it is very quiet which is a big bonus for us as a family as it is in our living room and in use so frequently. I myself have hypermobile joints so an added bonus of being beneficial to me also and not just my son. ” Amazon Customer Family in Ireland using at home Home » About Rebounding » Rebound Therapy Rebound Therapy to support Children and Young People with SEND ReboundTherapy.org have approved the use of the Fit Bounce Pro orthopaedic quality mini-trampoline for Flexi-Bounce Therapy; a comprehensive graded exercise and development programme for children and adults across a wide spectrum of additional needs.

E.G.Anderson Founder of Rebound Therapy Orthopaedic Rebounder - Spec Physiological Benefits Therapeutic Benefits Caring for the Carers Properties of an Orthopaedic Rebounder These are the properties that ReboundTherapy.Org look for and have assessed in approving the Fit Bounce Pro for use with their Flexi Bounce Therapy programme: Unique Three-fold effect on body organs, systems and muscles. Weight increases and decreases to the point of weightlessness There is acceleration from stillness to varying speeds There is deceleration from  varying speeds to stillness. Storage of potential energy as the trampoline bed is under tension with springs it is a potential energy source. Output of energy –  this varies according to the energy put in; the bed stores the input energy unto output. As in Newton’s 3rd Law of Motion. ‘for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction’. Potential for lifting a body into space – as a result of the storage of enery, the trampoline bed, when energised, has the potential for lifting a body into space. The amount of energy required will relate to the weight of the body to be lifted. Potential for initiating movement in a body from a distance – the input of energy can be at any point yet still produce output throughout the trampoline bed. However, that output is most effective from the centre of the trampoline bed. The technique of ‘popping’ uses this property to initiate control and movement. Unstable surface – the surface, which is elasticated and under spring tension, is unstable and movement on it acts to energise the bed. Output from this movement causes the bed to offer an active base upon which movement occurs. Damping – this is the absorption of the energy of the bed by the body. It is achieved by taking up some of the energy of the bed through flexed hips and knees. Variable Surface – the surface is changeable and can be deliberately arranged to enhance symmetry and to promote symmetrical weight-bearing, thus encouraging balance. Buy Flexi Bounce At Home Physiological Effects and Benefits of Flexi Bounce These are the Physiological Effects of Flexi -BounceTherapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: Cardio-Respiratory : There is a high demand on muscles to deal with the increased gravity produced on deceleration and in the control of movement required when gravity is in effect reduced, as in acceleration, causing an increase in the respiratory rate and subsequently the heart rate. As a direct consequence there is an upturn in venous and lymphatic drainage. The constant muscle work required to maintain position and balance increases the demand for oxygen. Muscle Tone : In simplistic terms, trampolining generally causes an increase in postural muscle tone, simple to prevent falling over. In Rebound Therapy, the effect on muscle tone hypertonia or hypotonia is variable. Low amplitive bouncing in general causes a reducing effect on hypertonia by bombarding the muscle spindle in much the same way as shaking causes a decrease in muscle tone. High amplitude bouncing can cause an increase in tone by stimulating the stretch receptors. The two properties can be used therefore to increase or decrease tone where required. The effect of the rebound activity on muscle tone can easily be observed in people with spasticity, either hemiplegic or athetoid, or by effect on ataxia where tone can be seen to undergo change. Postural Mechanism : Stimulating by bombarding the sensory systems through joints, muscle and skin can improve the output to the important postural muscles. Balance Mechanism : In creating a dynamic movement situation, so challenging balance mechanisms, observable improvement can be achieved. This is particularly relevant when working with adults where a dynamic balance situation is difficult to create in lying, sitting or kneeling. Kinaesthetic Awareness : By the multiple stimulation of joints, pressure stretch receptors, skin, muscles etc., kinaesthetic awareness is improved, leading to improved body image and spatial awareness. Got a Question? Therapeutic effects of Flexi Bounce These are the Therapeutic Effects of Flexi-Bounce Therapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: ON MOVEMENT : Movement can be facilitated at different stages of the bounce. The most active movement takes place at the top of the bounce where acceleration of the body equals the downthrust of gravity to allow a momentary “gravity-free” zone. A tiny body movement can produce a large effect with correctly applied bounce. Momentum and rhythm can be added to movement to help teach new movement skills and energise movement. Balance and equilibrium reactions can be achieved through stimulation of postural mechanisms; by creating a dynamic movement situation, protective and saving reactions can be developed. The anticipation of movement occurs because of the effects of timing, rhythm and momentum. An inhibiting or stimulating effect on muscle tone enables active movement to take place. By using good positioning and low amplitude bouncing, good relaxation is easily obtained. ON PERCEPTION : Body image, body part awareness and positional sense are enhanced through tactile and joint sensation. Increased perception of body image, spatial awareness combined with rhythm, and movement itself, greatly develop co-ordination. The experience of movement into space with the return to stability, while remaining in control, provides an enriched learning experience, for the motor-impaired person. ON COMMUNICATION : Due to cardio-respiratory effects, vocalisation is increased – with exclamations and gasps. Eye contact and concentration are enhanced by the “focus effect”. Request more information Caring for the Carers There are many emotional and physical demands of caring for an individual with a disability and indeed on the whole family which is often not addressed.  Parents and other family members feel that they just have to “get on with it” when in reality they need to be looking after themselves physically and emotionally in order to continue to provide the best care they can. This article by Angela Kelly from the “the special needs jungle” is particularly interesting and speaks about the many studies that have been conducted to highlight the risk to mental health, including increased stress and anxiety, depression and other emotional strains. They also refer to a growing literature on the potential positive aspects of parenting a disabled child, including increased meaning or growth, finding benefit and positive perceptions given the right circumstances and when appropriate support is in place, and studies looking at the impact on the wider family, including grandparents, and siblings. Spending money to support an individual with additional needs is often something that Parents do willingly, or can obtain funding from the various support organisations that are around. Rebound Therapy is well established as a fantastic exercise routine to support Children and Young People and Adults with SEND needs and with the development of Flexi Bounce Therapy bouncing can now be incorporated into a daily routine. The same equipment can be used by Carers/Parents and all the other family members to ensure that they can exercise in the comfort of their own home, and improve their fitness levels, strengthen and tone their body for the physical demands of their caring role, and most importantly have some fun and improve mental wellbeing.

Potential for initiating movement in a body from a distance – the input of energy can be at any point yet still produce output throughout the trampoline bed. However, that output is most effective from the centre of the trampoline bed. The technique of ‘popping’ uses this property to initiate control and movement. Unstable surface – the surface, which is elasticated and under spring tension, is unstable and movement on it acts to energise the bed. Output from this movement causes the bed to offer an active base upon which movement occurs. Damping – this is the absorption of the energy of the bed by the body. It is achieved by taking up some of the energy of the bed through flexed hips and knees. Variable Surface – the surface is changeable and can be deliberately arranged to enhance symmetry and to promote symmetrical weight-bearing, thus encouraging balance. Buy Flexi Bounce At Home Physiological Effects and Benefits of Flexi Bounce These are the Physiological Effects of Flexi -BounceTherapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: Cardio-Respiratory : There is a high demand on muscles to deal with the increased gravity produced on deceleration and in the control of movement required when gravity is in effect reduced, as in acceleration, causing an increase in the respiratory rate and subsequently the heart rate. As a direct consequence there is an upturn in venous and lymphatic drainage. The constant muscle work required to maintain position and balance increases the demand for oxygen. Muscle Tone : In simplistic terms, trampolining generally causes an increase in postural muscle tone, simple to prevent falling over. In Rebound Therapy, the effect on muscle tone hypertonia or hypotonia is variable. Low amplitive bouncing in general causes a reducing effect on hypertonia by bombarding the muscle spindle in much the same way as shaking causes a decrease in muscle tone. High amplitude bouncing can cause an increase in tone by stimulating the stretch receptors. The two properties can be used therefore to increase or decrease tone where required. The effect of the rebound activity on muscle tone can easily be observed in people with spasticity, either hemiplegic or athetoid, or by effect on ataxia where tone can be seen to undergo change. Postural Mechanism : Stimulating by bombarding the sensory systems through joints, muscle and skin can improve the output to the important postural muscles. Balance Mechanism : In creating a dynamic movement situation, so challenging balance mechanisms, observable improvement can be achieved. This is particularly relevant when working with adults where a dynamic balance situation is difficult to create in lying, sitting or kneeling. Kinaesthetic Awareness : By the multiple stimulation of joints, pressure stretch receptors, skin, muscles etc., kinaesthetic awareness is improved, leading to improved body image and spatial awareness. Got a Question? Therapeutic effects of Flexi Bounce These are the Therapeutic Effects of Flexi-Bounce Therapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: ON MOVEMENT : Movement can be facilitated at different stages of the bounce. The most active movement takes place at the top of the bounce where acceleration of the body equals the downthrust of gravity to allow a momentary “gravity-free” zone. A tiny body movement can produce a large effect with correctly applied bounce. Momentum and rhythm can be added to movement to help teach new movement skills and energise movement. Balance and equilibrium reactions can be achieved through stimulation of postural mechanisms; by creating a dynamic movement situation, protective and saving reactions can be developed. The anticipation of movement occurs because of the effects of timing, rhythm and momentum. An inhibiting or stimulating effect on muscle tone enables active movement to take place. By using good positioning and low amplitude bouncing, good relaxation is easily obtained. ON PERCEPTION : Body image, body part awareness and positional sense are enhanced through tactile and joint sensation. Increased perception of body image, spatial awareness combined with rhythm, and movement itself, greatly develop co-ordination. The experience of movement into space with the return to stability, while remaining in control, provides an enriched learning experience, for the motor-impaired person. ON COMMUNICATION : Due to cardio-respiratory effects, vocalisation is increased – with exclamations and gasps. Eye contact and concentration are enhanced by the “focus effect”. Request more information Caring for the Carers There are many emotional and physical demands of caring for an individual with a disability and indeed on the whole family which is often not addressed.  Parents and other family members feel that they just have to “get on with it” when in reality they need to be looking after themselves physically and emotionally in order to continue to provide the best care they can. This article by Angela Kelly from the “the special needs jungle” is particularly interesting and speaks about the many studies that have been conducted to highlight the risk to mental health, including increased stress and anxiety, depression and other emotional strains. They also refer to a growing literature on the potential positive aspects of parenting a disabled child, including increased meaning or growth, finding benefit and positive perceptions given the right circumstances and when appropriate support is in place, and studies looking at the impact on the wider family, including grandparents, and siblings. Spending money to support an individual with additional needs is often something that Parents do willingly, or can obtain funding from the various support organisations that are around. Rebound Therapy is well established as a fantastic exercise routine to support Children and Young People and Adults with SEND needs and with the development of Flexi Bounce Therapy bouncing can now be incorporated into a daily routine. The same equipment can be used by Carers/Parents and all the other family members to ensure that they can exercise in the comfort of their own home, and improve their fitness levels, strengthen and tone their body for the physical demands of their caring role, and most importantly have some fun and improve mental wellbeing.

Unstable surface – the surface, which is elasticated and under spring tension, is unstable and movement on it acts to energise the bed. Output from this movement causes the bed to offer an active base upon which movement occurs. Damping – this is the absorption of the energy of the bed by the body. It is achieved by taking up some of the energy of the bed through flexed hips and knees. Variable Surface – the surface is changeable and can be deliberately arranged to enhance symmetry and to promote symmetrical weight-bearing, thus encouraging balance.

Buy Flexi Bounce At Home Physiological Effects and Benefits of Flexi Bounce These are the Physiological Effects of Flexi -BounceTherapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: Cardio-Respiratory : There is a high demand on muscles to deal with the increased gravity produced on deceleration and in the control of movement required when gravity is in effect reduced, as in acceleration, causing an increase in the respiratory rate and subsequently the heart rate. As a direct consequence there is an upturn in venous and lymphatic drainage. The constant muscle work required to maintain position and balance increases the demand for oxygen. Muscle Tone : In simplistic terms, trampolining generally causes an increase in postural muscle tone, simple to prevent falling over. In Rebound Therapy, the effect on muscle tone hypertonia or hypotonia is variable. Low amplitive bouncing in general causes a reducing effect on hypertonia by bombarding the muscle spindle in much the same way as shaking causes a decrease in muscle tone. High amplitude bouncing can cause an increase in tone by stimulating the stretch receptors. The two properties can be used therefore to increase or decrease tone where required. The effect of the rebound activity on muscle tone can easily be observed in people with spasticity, either hemiplegic or athetoid, or by effect on ataxia where tone can be seen to undergo change. Postural Mechanism : Stimulating by bombarding the sensory systems through joints, muscle and skin can improve the output to the important postural muscles. Balance Mechanism : In creating a dynamic movement situation, so challenging balance mechanisms, observable improvement can be achieved. This is particularly relevant when working with adults where a dynamic balance situation is difficult to create in lying, sitting or kneeling. Kinaesthetic Awareness : By the multiple stimulation of joints, pressure stretch receptors, skin, muscles etc., kinaesthetic awareness is improved, leading to improved body image and spatial awareness.

Got a Question? Therapeutic effects of Flexi Bounce These are the Therapeutic Effects of Flexi-Bounce Therapy as stated by ReboundTherapy.Org: ON MOVEMENT : Movement can be facilitated at different stages of the bounce. The most active movement takes place at the top of the bounce where acceleration of the body equals the downthrust of gravity to allow a momentary “gravity-free” zone. A tiny body movement can produce a large effect with correctly applied bounce. Momentum and rhythm can be added to movement to help teach new movement skills and energise movement. Balance and equilibrium reactions can be achieved through stimulation of postural mechanisms; by creating a dynamic movement situation, protective and saving reactions can be developed. The anticipation of movement occurs because of the effects of timing, rhythm and momentum. An inhibiting or stimulating effect on muscle tone enables active movement to take place. By using good positioning and low amplitude bouncing, good relaxation is easily obtained. ON PERCEPTION : Body image, body part awareness and positional sense are enhanced through tactile and joint sensation. Increased perception of body image, spatial awareness combined with rhythm, and movement itself, greatly develop co-ordination. The experience of movement into space with the return to stability, while remaining in control, provides an enriched learning experience, for the motor-impaired person. ON COMMUNICATION : Due to cardio-respiratory effects, vocalisation is increased – with exclamations and gasps. Eye contact and concentration are enhanced by the “focus effect”.

This article by Angela Kelly from the “the special needs jungle” is particularly interesting and speaks about the many studies that have been conducted to highlight the risk to mental health, including increased stress and anxiety, depression and other emotional strains. They also refer to a growing literature on the potential positive aspects of parenting a disabled child, including increased meaning or growth, finding benefit and positive perceptions given the right circumstances and when appropriate support is in place, and studies looking at the impact on the wider family, including grandparents, and siblings. Spending money to support an individual with additional needs is often something that Parents do willingly, or can obtain funding from the various support organisations that are around. Rebound Therapy is well established as a fantastic exercise routine to support Children and Young People and Adults with SEND needs and with the development of Flexi Bounce Therapy bouncing can now be incorporated into a daily routine. The same equipment can be used by Carers/Parents and all the other family members to ensure that they can exercise in the comfort of their own home, and improve their fitness levels, strengthen and tone their body for the physical demands of their caring role, and most importantly have some fun and improve mental wellbeing.

There are many emotional and physical demands of caring for an individual with a disability and indeed on the whole family which is often not addressed.  Parents and other family members feel that they just have to “get on with it” when in reality they need to be looking after themselves physically and emotionally in order to continue to provide the best care they can.

What Flexi Bounce Customers have to say ... “ The rebounder is being used in school by a 13 year old boy who has limited communication and is at the lower functioning end of the autism spectrum. We use the rebounder with him at various times of the day. This helps break up his timetable and gives him his own space in between learning. He enjoys using it, and it can be particularly helpful if the pupil is becoming agitated or distressed to allow him some extra time on it. I have to say that the advice and support received from the company was second to none - they went out of their way to ensure the correct product was purchased. We are delighted with the Fit Bounce Pro and would highly recommend it. ” Amazon Customer Special Needs School; Feb 2016 “ Rebound Fitness have designed an orthopaedic quality folding rebounder specifically for Flexi-Bounce Therapy - the Fit Bounce Pro XL. Its unique characteristic is that it folds in half which makes it easy to store and ideal for use in the home and by professionals such as Fitness Trainers, Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists, Personal Trainers etc. The Fit Bounce Pro XL has a slow, soft and virtually silent bounce due to the individual elastic springs. (Many rebounders have metal springs which can give a noisy, hard bounce.) and is one of only three orthopaedic quality rebounders worldwide that is recommended by Rebound Therapy International. ” Paul Kaye Rebound Therapy.Org - CEO “ I got this rebounder for my son who is 15 with autism. His condition means he needs to bounce frequently to regulate his sensory system and to expend energy, so we have always had some type of mini trampoline in our living room. We needed a strong rebounder & the Fit Bounce Pro fits the bill perfectly as it is very quiet which is a big bonus for us as a family as it is in our living room and in use so frequently. I myself have hypermobile joints so an added bonus of being beneficial to me also and not just my son. ” Amazon Customer Family in Ireland using at home    What Flexi Bounce Customers have to say ... “ The rebounder is being used in school by a 13 year old boy who has limited communication and is at the lower functioning end of the autism spectrum.
