Your cart is empty Your frequently asked questions answered You can view our Privacy Policy here:Privacy Policy (https://sunnyhealthfitness.com/pages/privacy-policy). All Sunny Health and Fitness items have a Product Warranty. To view the details and specifics, you can read it here:Manufacturer Limited Warranty (https://sunnyhealthfitness.com/pages/warranty). The Golden State: Los Angeles, California. It takes 1-2 business days for us to process your order once you have submitted it. Once it's processed, it will then ship out and take another 1-5 business days to deliver depending on what state you live in and what delivery options you chose (Economy, Ground, 3-Day, Next Day, etc). For more info on our Shipping policy, click here:Shipping Policy (https://sunnyhealthfitness.com/pages/shipping-policy). No, we only ship within the contiguous US 48 states, excluding Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico....and also excluding any PO BOXES (sorry, but we can't ship our items to any PO BOX, period). Your Proof of Purchase is nothing more than just a receipt. This sales transcript must contain an Order#, Item #, Customer Address, Date of Sale and Date of Shipment. You can obtain these from the retailer in which you purchased your Sunny product from. In most cases, your purchase was made online and thus you can download your receipts form your retailer. You will be charged at the time of order so that we can start the processing of your order and prepare the items for shipment. While your order processing typically takes 1-2 business days for processing, during high demand or peak season, you may experience 3-7 business days of processing after your payment before your order is shipped out. It takes 1-2 business days for us to process your order once you have submitted it. Once its processed, it will then ship out and take another 1-5 business days to deliver depending on what state you live in, and what delivery options you chose. For more info on our Shipping policy, click here:Shipping Policy (https://sunnyhealthfitness.com/pages/shipping-policy). There are couple possible reasons for why a coupon code didn’t work in your cart. The coupon codes offered for our website are typically one use per customer only, so if it has been used by you before, it cannot be used again. Another reason could be that the coupon has expired. Coupons also cannot be combined with any other offers. Coupon codes are not valid for prior purchases. They cannot be added retrospectively by you or by the Sunny team. Coupon code must be entered at the time of checkout in order to be applied. If you have not received an email from us stating that it shipped out, we can still make changes. But once it leaves our facility and is in the hands of the shipping carrier, there is nothing we can do at that point. You'll have to follow the return instructions from our return policy and return the item to make changes. For more info on our Return policy, click here:Refund & Return Policy (https://sunnyhealthfitness.com/pages/return-policy) There are many of reasons this may have happened: • Sometimes an item has run out of stock at the time you purchased it. Our inventory says we had it, but its not here. It happens to the best of us.• We do not ship to PO BOXES, and our web system will catch it and auto-cancels your order.• You have been a blacklisted customer and are no longer allowed to purchase with us. The Extend Protection Plan begins when the manufacturer’s warranty ends and protects against mechanical or electrical breakdown, including those experienced during normal wear and tear as well as those caused by a direct result of a power surge. This plan does not cover accidental damage. The Extend Protection Plan is a single replacement program that allows for a 1-time replacement of a like or comparable product should it become defective. A protection plan can be purchased through the participating merchant online or through their customer care team over the phone. Extend provides peace of mind and financial protection should there be a mechanical or electrical breakdown, normal wear and tear, or breakdown caused by power surge with your product even after the manufacturer’s warranty ends. Extend is a reliable service that makes purchasing and filing claims on protection plans easy through an easy-to-use online portal and great customer experience team.

Yes, the replacement product will continue to be covered under Extend’s protection plan. Unfortunately, No we do not. However, if your item you just received has issues, arrived damaged or isn't working (malfunctioning), of course you won't have to pay to return it. We will provide you with return shipping at no cost to you. But if you would like to return the item that is in 100% working good condition, we will still gladly take the return back.

All our products come with assembly instructions within the User Manual booklet. If further assistance is needed, you can always call our Service line at877-907-8669. Firstly, take a deep breath. It's hard for major shipping carriers to deliver heavy packages across the USA perfectly every single time. We suggest to open the box and take a look inside. The items come packaged fairly well on the inside, so just because the outside box is dinged up, doesn't mean what's inside is dinged as well. If you do encounter an issue, contact us immediately. Don't start disassembling the item and packing things back up in the box just yet. Reach out to us first and see if there's an easier solution. We carry many of replacement parts and knowledgeable staff to help troubleshoot any situation. You can reach out to us through our online contact us form here:Contact Us Form (https://support.sunnyhealthfitness.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
