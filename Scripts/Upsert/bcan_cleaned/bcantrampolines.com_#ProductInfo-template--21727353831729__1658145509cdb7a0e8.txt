"I am almost 65 and I was a little worried about putting this together after reading review. It wasn't bad at all. It took about 30 minutes. After the first week of using this, I am feeling more in shape already. My 80 year old hubby is using it too. There are tons of you tube videos that are very helpful. I have the ,40" bungee with handle. 164 lbs It has good bounce." ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ————————beth j "Mine came with some bungee cords already assembled so had to remove some to get it into the opened up position. The cords with using the hook tool to pull them down then the triangle tool to flip them around the bar and onto the mat hooks works perfectly. Very easy to set up. It's quiet and has a perfect bounce . I can really get into it. 100% recommend."  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ————————A. Whoever "I am 75, my daughter and I put it together. I thought she broke my thumbs though because the tool used to put the bungee cords on broke and hit my thumb. Aside from that it went together fairly quickly and it's the right size, with plenty of space for jumping around. I'm glad I got the bar but you don't have to use it if you're not as clumsy as I am.".  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ————————Dr. S Monday - Friday 9am - 5pm PST Email:bcanaftersaleservice@gmail.com  Home BCAN Mini Trampoline BCAN Mini Trampoline Max Load 170LBS/300LBS Max Load 330lbs/440lbs Max Load 450lbs/550lbs For Kids BLOG About BCAN Log in Twitter Facebook Pinterest Instagram YouTube Home BCAN Mini Trampoline Max Load 170LBS/300LBS Max Load 330lbs/440lbs Max Load 450lbs/550lbs For Kids BLOG About BCAN Search Log in Cart Item added to your cart Check out Continue shopping Home BCAN Mini Trampoline BCAN Mini Trampoline Max Load 170LBS/300LBS Max Load 330lbs/440lbs Max Load 450lbs/550lbs For Kids BLOG About BCAN Log in Twitter Facebook Pinterest Instagram YouTube Home BCAN Mini Trampoline BCAN Mini Trampoline Max Load 170LBS/300LBS Max Load 330lbs/440lbs Max Load 450lbs/550lbs For Kids BLOG About BCAN Log in Twitter Facebook Pinterest Instagram YouTube Home BCAN Mini Trampoline BCAN Mini Trampoline Max Load 170LBS/300LBS Max Load 330lbs/440lbs Max Load 450lbs/550lbs For Kids BLOG About BCAN Log in Twitter Facebook Pinterest Instagram YouTube BCAN Mini Trampoline Max Load 170LBS/300LBS Max Load 330lbs/440lbs Max Load 450lbs/550lbs BCAN Mini Trampoline Max Load 170LBS/300LBS Max Load 330lbs/440lbs Max Load 450lbs/550lbs Log in Twitter Facebook Pinterest Instagram YouTube Search Log in Cart Search  Search Search   Item added to your cart Check out Continue shopping Item added to your cart Check out Continue shopping Item added to your cart  Check out Continue shopping 2 / of 2 1 2          2 / of 2 2 / of 2 1 2 1 2 Fast&Free Fast&Free Shipping From local warehouses Warranty Lifetime Official Tech-Support Hassle-Free 30 Days Money Back Guarantee Secure payment No Payment information will be stored. 1 / of 2 Fast&Free Fast&Free Shipping From local warehouses Warranty Lifetime Official Tech-Support Hassle-Free 30 Days Money Back Guarantee Secure payment No Payment information will be stored. 1 / of 2 Fast&Free Fast&Free Shipping From local warehouses Warranty Lifetime Official Tech-Support Hassle-Free 30 Days Money Back Guarantee Secure payment No Payment information will be stored. 1 / of 2 Fast&Free Fast&Free Shipping From local warehouses Fast&Free Fast&Free Shipping From local warehouses Fast&Free Shipping From local warehouses Warranty Lifetime Official Tech-Support Warranty Lifetime Official Tech-Support Lifetime Official Tech-Support Hassle-Free 30 Days Money Back Guarantee Hassle-Free 30 Days Money Back Guarantee 30 Days Money Back Guarantee Secure payment No Payment information will be stored.

What our customers say? What our customers say? "I am almost 65 and I was a little worried about putting this together after reading review. It wasn't bad at all. It took about 30 minutes. After the first week of using this, I am feeling more in shape already. My 80 year old hubby is using it too. There are tons of you tube videos that are very helpful. I have the ,40" bungee with handle. 164 lbs It has good bounce." ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ———————— beth j "Mine came with some bungee cords already assembled so had to remove some to get it into the opened up position. The cords with using the hook tool to pull them down then the triangle tool to flip them around the bar and onto the mat hooks works perfectly. Very easy to set up. It's quiet and has a perfect bounce . I can really get into it. 100% recommend." ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ———————— A. Whoever "I am 75, my daughter and I put it together. I thought she broke my thumbs though because the tool used to put the bungee cords on broke and hit my thumb. Aside from that it went together fairly quickly and it's the right size, with plenty of space for jumping around. I'm glad I got the bar but you don't have to use it if you're not as clumsy as I am.". ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ———————— Dr. S "I am almost 65 and I was a little worried about putting this together after reading review.
